# Slide 19 of Lecture 1 contains information about And a world of tradeoffs – E.g. holding Costs for inventory vs. transportation are a key example of such tradeoffs.

# The image in slide 19 of Lecture 1 is a graph with three distinct curves representing costs in relation to order quantity. The x-axis is labeled "Order Qty," and the y-axis is labeled "Costs $." 

1. **Axes**:
   - The x-axis (horizontal) has the label "Order Qty."
   - The y-axis (vertical) has the label "Costs $."

2. **Curves and Labels**:
   - **Total Cost**: A curve with a U-shape starting from the top left, curving downwards and then upwards, with a money bag symbol at its peak.
   - **Cost of Ordering**: A downward-sloping curve starting high on the left and decreasing towards the right, with a money bag symbol near its end. It is labeled "Cost of Ordering."
   - **Cost of Holding**: An upward-sloping curve starting near the bottom left, curving upwards, with a money bag symbol at its starting point. It is labeled "Cost of Holding."

3. **Equilibrium Point**:
   - The point where the "Cost of Ordering" and "Cost of Holding" curves intersect is marked with a vertical dashed line labeled "EOQ."

4. **Symbols and Imagery**:
   - Several symbols representing different components:
     - A house-like structure at the start point of the "Cost of Holding" curve.
     - A series of stacked coins or spheres next to the label "Order Qty."
     - Various geometric shapes and house-like symbols are scattered alongside curves.

5. **Visual Elements**:
   - The graph background is black with white lines and labels.
   - A small notation "E/102" is in the bottom left corner.

Overall, the graph visualizes the relationship between order quantity and costs, highlighting the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) where ordering and holding costs meet.
