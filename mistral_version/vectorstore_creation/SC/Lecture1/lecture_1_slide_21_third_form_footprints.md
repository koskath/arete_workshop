# Slide 21 of Lecture 1 contains information about But there is more: Footprints of another, third form
# The image in slide 21 of Lecture 1 displays a chaotic traffic scene:

This chaotic traffic scene is illustrating the concept of a third type of flow in logistics beyond the material and information flows shown in the previous slide.
The "third form" most likely refers to financial flows (or money flows):

Payment transactions
Invoicing
Credit terms
Financial settlements between parties

The chaotic motorcycle traffic serves as a metaphor for the complexity of managing logistics when you add this third dimension. Just as this intersection appears to have no clear order or control, logistics systems can become chaotic when trying to coordinate:

Material flows (physical goods moving)
Information flows (orders, data, communications)
Financial flows (money, payments, settlements)

All three must flow smoothly and in sync for effective supply chain management. If any one of these flows breaks down or isn't properly coordinated with the others, you get "chaos" - similar to this traffic scene where everyone is moving but there's no clear coordination or efficiency.
The image powerfully conveys that managing logistics isn't just about moving goods and processing information - it's also about ensuring the financial transactions flow correctly alongside the physical and information flows. When all three aren't synchronized, the system becomes as chaotic as this intersection.
