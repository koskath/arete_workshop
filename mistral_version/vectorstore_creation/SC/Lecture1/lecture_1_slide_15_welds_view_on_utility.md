# Slide 15 of Lecture 1 contains information about Welds View on Utility – an old piece of literature


The purpose of this slide is to introduce a fundamental concept: logistics creates value, not just cost. Logistics adds time and place utility to products. The key highlighted concepts are:

Form utility - This is created by manufacturing. An assembled automobile is more valuable than its unassembled parts because manufacturing has transformed raw materials into a finished product.
Place, time, and possession utility - This is what logistics creates. Even a perfectly manufactured product has limited value if it's: In the wrong place (sitting in a factory far from customers) or At the wrong time (not available when customers want to buy it) or Not accessible for purchase

The critical insight is: A product must not only have form utility (be manufactured), it must be in the right place, at the right time, and be available to purchase.
The text emphasizes that management should be concerned with the "value added" by logistics - it's not just a cost center, but actually contributes significantly to a firm's profits. Logistics can create cost savings or improve a company's market position through better availability and service. In essence, logistics is a value-creating activity that makes products more useful to customers by ensuring they're available where and when needed - which is just as important as making the product in the first place.
