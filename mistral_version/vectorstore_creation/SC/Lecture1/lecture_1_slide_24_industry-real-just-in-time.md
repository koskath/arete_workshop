# Slide 24 of Lecture 1 contains information about Industry: „real“ Just-in-Time
# The image in slide 24 of Lecture 1 contains a schematic diagram and a photograph:

1. **Schematic Diagram (Left Side):**
   - Title at the top: "Integration of collaborating system partners into the production process"
   - The diagram is a complex map showing integration flow among different entities, featuring a central circular area from which multiple red and blue arrows extend.
   - **Central Circular Hub:**
     - Number "8" inside a circle, representing "Ständig operative Einrichtung für Systempartnerforum" in the legend.
     - Red arrows extend from this circle to four other points in a cross-shaped layout.
   - **Main Points:**
     - **Point at the bottom (1):** Connected by a red arrow, labeled with "1" in a blue circle. It stands for "Montage Safety-Bodyframe."
     - **Point on the left (2):** Connected by a red arrow, labeled with "2" in a blue circle. It stands for "Montage Fahrwerks- und Antriebs-Modul."
     - **Point at the top (3):** Connected by red arrows leading to "Bosch, Rhenus," labeled with "3" in a blue circle, representing "Verglasung, Sitzsysteme."
     - **Point on the right (4):** Connected by parallel red and blue arrows leading to "Dynamit Nobel," labeled with "4" in a blue circle, representing "Interieur-Dekor-Elemente."
   - **Additional Points:**
     - **Point on the left side between central hub and left main point (2):** Labeled with "5" in blue circle, signifying "Customized-Design-System."
     - **Point on the right side between central hub and right main point (4):** Labeled with "6" in a blue circle, indicating "Probelaus, Funktionstest."
     - **Point at the bottom next to point (1):** Labeled with "7" in a blue circle, representing "Qualitäts-Audit."
   - All labeled points are interconnected by red and blue arrows showing flows or connections. 
   - There is a blue circle on the upper right of the diagram depicting a light shaded version of the schematic with additional circular icons.
   - **Labels at Opposite Corners:**
     - Top left: "Bosch, Rhenus."
     - Top right: "Dynamit Nobel."
     - Bottom left: "Hoesch."
     - Bottom right: "PVZ."

2. **Legend (Bottom Left):** Provides descriptions for numbered points in the schematic within a white box labeled "Legende."

3. **Bullet Point List (Right Side, Top):** Text highlights key aspects:
   - "Maximale Länge der Montagelinie, minimale Kommunikationswege"
   - "Just-in-time-Bereitstellung der Module"
   - "Flexibel anpaßbare Materialströme - 'Durchlässige Fassade'"
   - "Nacharbeit transparent im Zentrum"

4. **Photograph (Right Bottom):**
   - An aerial view of an industrial facility with several rectangular buildings, roads, and parking areas.
   - The facility is expansive, on a large plot of land with visible greenery and surrounding spaces.

The overall structure combines diagrammatic representation with supplementary explanatory and photographic content, showcasing an integrated production process with designated partners and roles.
