# Slide 6 of Lecture 1 contains information about Just a stupid metaphor?

# The image in slide 6 of lecture 1 contains:
a sports metaphor (with a touch of self-aware humor in the title) to illustrate an important concept in supply chain management: the value of being a "complete player" rather than a specialist in just one area.
In the slide, he's comparing a versatile football/soccer player—who can play multiple positions and isn't just one-sided—to what's needed in supply chain management. The key point is that flexibility and a mixture of different qualities make someone truly valuable and "complete."
The metaphor likely translates to supply chain professionals needing to:

Understand multiple aspects of the supply chain (procurement, logistics, operations, strategy, etc.)
Be adaptable and able to work across different functions
Combine various skills and perspectives rather than being narrowly specialized
See the "whole game" rather than just their specific position

The humorous title "Just a stupid sport metaphor?" suggests Professor Prockl knows some people roll their eyes at sports analogies in business contexts, but he's using it anyway because it effectively drives home the point about versatility and completeness being essential in modern supply chain management. It's his way of saying, "Yes, I know this might seem cliché, but there's real wisdom here."
