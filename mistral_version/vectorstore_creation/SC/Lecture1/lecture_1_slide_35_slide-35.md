# Slide 35 of Lecture 1 contains information about The “Full” Supply Chain: A Sequence of S‘s

This slide presents "The Full Supply Chain: A Sequence of S's" - showing the complete supply chain as a series of interconnected entities from raw materials to final consumption.
Each "S" curve represents: A company or entity in the supply chain, The internal flows and processes within that organization, Each entity simultaneously acts as both a supplier (to the next stage) and a customer (to the previous stage)

The sequence flows through: Primary Products/Raw Materials - extraction/agriculture, Parts/Components - manufacturing of parts, OEM Products - original equipment manufacturers (finished products), Distribution - wholesalers/retailers, Final Use/Consumption - end customers
The three flows are shown:Information (orange) → flows forward (and backward), Product/Service (red) → flows forward through the chain, Money (blue) → flows backward from customer to supplier, Each box labeled "Customer" between the S's emphasizes that every entity in the chain is someone else's customer - this creates interdependencies throughout the network, The S-shape within each entity represents the complex internal processes - receiving, transforming, and sending forward, It's not just one company's supply chain - it's an entire network spanning from raw material extraction to final consumption

The critical question at the bottom:
"How to configure entire economy-wide Supply Chains for competitiveness?"
