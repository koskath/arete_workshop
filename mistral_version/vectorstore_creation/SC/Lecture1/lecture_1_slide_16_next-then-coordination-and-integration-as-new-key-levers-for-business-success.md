# Slide 16 of Lecture 1 contains information about Next then: Coordination and Integration as new key levers for business success
“80% of errors and problems within companies occur at the interfaces between functions, not within the functions...” (Fukuda). Against this background, logistics can be seen as an “art and science” of coordination, dealing with trade-offs and interfaces through planning and optimizing, with a new focus on information processing.

A key management question, therefore, is how to coordinate and control “divided” functions in sequential, “distributed” systems. Plowman’s “Seven Rights” (the right goods, in the right quantity, to the right place, …) exemplify this, and position logistics as a cross-sectional function.
