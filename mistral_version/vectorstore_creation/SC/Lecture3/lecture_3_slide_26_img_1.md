# The image 1 in slide 26 of lecture 3 contains:
The image features an ice hockey stick set against a plain white background. The stick is oriented diagonally, with the blade on the bottom right corner and the handle towards the top left corner of the image.

The hockey stick comprises two main parts: the blade and the shaft. 

1. **Blade**: 
   - The blade is on the lower portion of the stick and is black in color.
   - It has a slight curvature that becomes more pronounced towards the end.
   - The blade's edge is thin and consistently shaped from heel to toe.

2. **Shaft**:
   - The shaft extends upward from the blade, forming the main body of the stick.
   - It has a sleek and straight design.
   - The shaft is predominantly black, featuring white geometric patterns and text.
   - There are sections where the name "GRAF" appears in white, prominently displayed horizontally on the shaft.
   - The patterns include diagonal lines, various shapes, and accents that are primarily white, in contrast with the black background of the shaft.

The stick shows a well-balanced design with a modern aesthetic typical of sports equipment used in hockey. There are no additional elements or annotations visible in the image.
