# The image 1 in slide 34 of lecture 3 contains:
The image consists of a diagram titled "The Partnership Model" at the top, with a dark gray background for the title section. Below the title, there are four circular shapes arranged in a network structure to illustrate the partnership model.

1. **Left Circle (Drivers)**
   - Color: Light gray.
   - Text: "Drivers
     Compelling reasons to partner"
   - A dashed line labeled "Drivers set expectations of outcomes" extends from this circle downwards and connects to the "Outcomes" circle.

2. **Upper Center Circle (Decision)**
   - Color: Light gray.
   - Positioned to the right of the "Drivers" circle.
   - Text: "Decision to create or adjust partnership"
   - Arrows extend from this circle to two other circles:
     - Right arrow to "Facilitators."
     - Downward arrow to "Components."

3. **Right Circle (Facilitators)**
   - Color: Light gray.
   - Text: "Facilitators
     Supportive environmental factors that enhance partnership growth"
   - Positioned to the right of the "Decision" circle at the top.

4. **Lower Center Circle (Components)**
   - Color: Light blue.
   - Positioned below the "Decision" circle.
   - Text: "Components
     Joint activities and processes that build and sustain the partnership"
   - A downward arrow connects this circle to the "Outcomes" circle.

5. **Bottom Circle (Outcomes)**
   - Color: Light gray.
   - Positioned below the "Components" circle.
   - Text: "Outcomes
     The extent to which performance meets expectations"

Below the diagram, there is a paragraph providing contextual information:

"When the member companies of the Global Supply Chain Forum first convened in 1992, they agreed they needed insights on how to build effective partnerships. Research on their experiences formed the basis of a model that has been refined through dozens of partnership facilitation sessions. Managers state the drivers behind their desire to partner and examine the conditions that would facilitate cooperation. The model helps them decide on a partnership type and boost the needed managerial components. Later, if the partners aren’t happy with the relationship, they determine whether drivers or facilitators have changed or components are at an appropriate level."

At the bottom left, outside the paragraph, there is a small acknowledgment:
