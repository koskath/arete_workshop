# Slide 31 of Lecture 3 contains information about The “prisoner’s dilemma” decision
The image, titled "The 'prisoner's dilemma' decision," utilizes a classic game theory payoff matrix to model the strategic challenges inherent in a supply chain partnership by pitting the immediate self-interest of two actors against the benefits of long-term cooperation. If the two partners (Prisoner 1 and Prisoner 2) choose to cooperate, or "Doesn't confess," they achieve the best collective outcome (6 months, 6 months), representing an efficient and profitable supply chain relationship. However, the structure of the dilemma means each partner has a massive incentive to "Breaks agreement not to confess," or act selfishly, because if one betrays while the other cooperates, the betrayer goes free while the cooperator receives the maximum penalty (10 years). Since both partners recognize this incentive to exploit the other for maximum individual gain, they rationally choose to betray each other, leading to the Nash Equilibrium outcome of 5 years, 5 years. This result is worse for both parties than if they had simply trusted and cooperated, effectively demonstrating why single-company focus and a lack of trust can prevent supply chain partners from achieving the most efficient outcomes, leading to instability and reduced collective profitability.
