# Slide 41 of Lecture 3 contains information about The smile in a more dynamic analysis Spillover effects and catch-up

The image, titled "The smile in a more dynamic analysis: Spillover effects and catch-up," presents a dynamic view of the U-shaped Smile of Value Creation by integrating the concepts of globalization and knowledge transfer . The ends of the smile, where the highest Value Added is concentrated, are dominated by Advanced economies that specialize in Intangibles and Services requiring R&D Knowledge and Marketing Knowledge. Conversely, the central, low-value trough is occupied by Emerging market economies focusing on Tangibles and Manufacturing. The diagram introduces two critical dynamic processes: Spillover effects, which represents the transfer of knowledge from the advanced economies to the emerging market economies, and Catch-up, which illustrates the continuous effort of the emerging markets to move into the higher value-added ends of the supply chain, shifting their focus away from basic manufacturing toward more sophisticated services and knowledge-intensive activities. This model highlights that the global supply chain is not static but involves a continuous process of knowledge dissemination and competition where different nations strategically compete to increase their share of value creation along the curve.
