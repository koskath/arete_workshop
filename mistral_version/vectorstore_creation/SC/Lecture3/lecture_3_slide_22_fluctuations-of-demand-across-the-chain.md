# Slide 22 of Lecture 3 contains information about Fluctuations of Demand across the Chain
The final image, titled "Fluctuations of Demand across the Chain," introduces the critical supply chain concept of the Bullwhip Effect and the fundamental trade-off of inventory management, which directly relates to the objectives of the actors in the second image. The concept of the "Ugly Tradeoff"—Lost Sales vs. Increased holding costs—is central, as it pits the Retailers' goals of getting low holding costs against the need to ensure Shelf availability, OSA to prevent lost sales to the Consumers who simply want what demanded. The accompanying graphs visually demonstrate the Bullwhip Effect: in the "Chicken Soup USA" example, the Producer's demand curve exhibits significantly higher peaks and troughs than the Retailer's demand curve over the same nine-month period, illustrating how small changes in consumer demand are amplified upstream as orders move through the supply chain. Similarly, the "Pasta Italy" graph shows high volatility in Producer demand units, emphasizing the difficulty the Exceso, Manuf. unit would face in trying to fulfill forecasts and utilize machine capacity under such unpredictable market conditions. This inherent market volatility and demand amplification directly impacts the ability of the Exceso, Sales team to get realistic goals and influences the pressure on Fleming Valumart, HQ to balance its pursuit of max discounts with maintaining inventory levels sufficient to meet volatile market needs.
