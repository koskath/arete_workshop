# The image 1 in slide 23 of lecture 3 contains:
The image is a flowchart diagram with sections labeled "company target," "evaluation components," "value drivers," and "decisions along the financial supply chain."

1. **Company Target Section (Top Region):**
   - Contains a horizontal sequence:
     - Square box labeled "company value."
     - Plus sign leading to two branching arrows.
     - Circle with a labeled shareholder value is connected to the plus sign.
     - Minus sign branching to the right.
     - Box with "market value of outside capital" at the far right end of the sequence.

2. **Evaluation Components Section (Middle Region):**
   - Two horizontal rectangles labeled:
     - "Cash value of free cash flow (forecast period)"
     - "Cash value of the residual value"
   - Both connect to a single rectangle labeled "free cash flow (forecast period)" below.
   - To the right, two rectangles:
     - "Bank rate (WACC)"
     - "Outside capital"
   - An arrow from "Bank rate (WACC)" leads to "Outside capital."

3. **Value Drivers Section (Middle-Bottom Region):**
   - Contains a series of connected factors:
     - "Duration of the value increase"
     - "Turnover - growth rate - margin - tax rate"
     - "Investment - current assets, investment - fixed assets"
     - "Capital costs"
   - Each factor is boxed and connected with horizontal and vertical lines leading to respective evaluation components.

4. **Decisions Along the Financial Supply Chain Section (Bottom Region):**
   - Central oval labeled "Working Capital."
   - A line connects "Working Capital" upwards to squares and rectangles from the evaluation components and value drivers.
   - The oval is surrounded by text: "Management of capital disposition & capital requirement."

5. **Annotations and Arrows:**
   - Multiple arrows coordinate the flow between the sections, showing relationships and data flow through the components.
   - The overall flow is from top sections to bottom, illustrating a hierarchy or process.

This organized structure visually represents the relationships between financial elements, evaluation criteria, and working capital management within a company.
