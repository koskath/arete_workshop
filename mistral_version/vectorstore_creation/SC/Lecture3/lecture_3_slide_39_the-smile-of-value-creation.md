# Slide 39 of Lecture 3 contains information about “The Smile of Value Creation”

The image, titled "The Smile of Value Creation," illustrates how value-added activities are distributed across the Value Chain Activities of a product, forming a U-shaped curve that resembles a smile . This model suggests that the least amount of value is added during the central Production phase, while the highest value is captured in the Pre-Production and Post-Production phases. The Pre-Production phase, at the left end of the "smile," focuses on high value-added activities such as basic and applied R&D, design, and commercialization. The central Production phase, which often involves manufacturing and standardized services, adds less value and is frequently outsourced to different locations. Finally, the Post-Production phase, at the right end of the "smile," adds high value through activities like marketing, advertising and brand management, specialized logistics, and after-sales services. The Value Chain Disaggregation shown below the curve further illustrates how different activities are often performed in separate locations (1 through 5), indicating a globally dispersed supply chain where the Focal Company concentrates on the high-value ends of the chain while potentially outsourcing the lower-value middle.
