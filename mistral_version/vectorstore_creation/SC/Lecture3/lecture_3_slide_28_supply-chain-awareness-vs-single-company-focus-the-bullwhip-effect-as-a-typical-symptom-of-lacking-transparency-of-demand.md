# Slide 28 of Lecture 3 contains information about Supply Chain Awareness vs. Single company focus The Bullwhip-Effect as a typical symptom of lacking transparency of demand

The image, titled "Supply Chain Awareness vs. Single company focus" and highlighting "The Bullwhip-Effect as a typical symptom of lacking transparency of demand," clearly illustrates how demand variability is significantly amplified as orders move up the supply chain. The central graphic demonstrates The Extent of Artificial Demand Distortion, using an example where weekly soft-drink sales recorded at the Customer Sales (Electronic Point of Sales) level varied from 18,000 to 60,000 cases over 32 weeks, representing the true consumer demand. However, the subsequent order patterns show increasing volatility: the Orders that stores place at the regional distribution center (RDC) show higher peaks and troughs, and by the time the Orders the RDC places at the supplier to replenish product are recorded, the range of distortion has ballooned dramatically to 0 to 205,000 cases. This progressive amplification of demand variability, symbolized visually by the whip next to the title, is the core Bullwhip Effect, confirming that a Single company focus on local optimization (e.g., placing large, infrequent orders to reduce shipping costs or speculative buying) results in a severe lacking transparency of demand across the entire chain, leading to massive inefficiencies for the upstream supplier.
