The image titled "Actors and their objectives" provides a critical overview of the individual goals driving the key agents within the supply chain, which often leads to inherent conflicts and strategic trade-offs. The Manufacturer (Exceso) is driven from the top by the CEO's financial objectives to attract analysts and money and push sales by 9%. This ambitious target is then pushed to the Sales team, who must realize CEO goals while simultaneously trying to secure realistic goals to lower CEO expectations, highlighting a core internal tension. Operationally, the Manufacturing unit focuses on efficiency by aiming to utilize machine capacity and fulfill forecasts. The Retail channel, represented by Fleming Valumart, HQ, prioritizes financial gains by seeking max discounts, achieving low holding costs, and securing promotions from the producer, demonstrating their intent to shift financial risk and cost upstream. At the consumer-facing level, the Fleming Valumart, Store aims for high service levels through maximizing shelf availability (OSA) and ensuring customer satisfaction by having the desired product configurations (e.g., 8packs when 8packs are wanted). The external actors, the Analysts, play a crucial role by seeking to get a sound picture of Exceso and providing realistic analysis to shareholders, thereby linking the supply chain's performance to the financial markets. Ultimately, the entire system is motivated by the Consumers in the markets whose simple, uniform goal is to get what demanded, good products to reasonable prize. This matrix of goals underscores that successful supply chain management requires sophisticated negotiation and coordination to reconcile these often-conflicting objectives for overall system efficiency.
