# Slide 15 of Lecture 14 contains information about Are there other ways to organize production – Basic Layout-types Why, how?
Table with 3 columns: Criteria for the Organization, Basic Type - Characteristics, Key Advantage Key Disadvantage
The production Product layout „line“, „flowshop layout“ is a layout that uses standardized process and processing operations to achieve smooth, rapid, high-volume flow, so high volume production with unlearned but specialized workers is possible, although high initial setupcostsand setuptimes mean that it is thusinflexible. In this context, a linear arrangement of specialized workstations is used to produce a specific product. The machine Process layout , „job shop layout“ allows fordifferent productroutings and therefore offers flexibility. In this case, centers/machines are grouped by the process they perform so that departments (sewing, kitting… and other single tasks) can use more universal machinery, but this creates a need forrouting, scheduling, and transportationbetween single production steps as well as additional setups. The final product Fixed Position Layout is suitable forbig single products/processes and for „one time“ projects. Here, the product/ project is stationary, while workers, materials, and equipment are moved as needed, and this layout is used in projects where the product cannot be moved.
