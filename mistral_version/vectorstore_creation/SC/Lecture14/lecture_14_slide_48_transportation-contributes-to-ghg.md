# Slide 48 of Lecture 14 contains information about Transportation contributes to GHG

This slide highlights the significant role transportation plays in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The pie chart shows that while non-transport sectors account for 76% of emissions, the transport sector alone contributes a substantial **24%** within the EEA-32. The breakdown on the right reveals that **road transport dominates**, responsible for **17%** of total emissions, while international maritime transport and aviation each contribute **3%**, and other transport modes add the remaining **1%**.
In the context of the lecture, this visualization reinforces the message that logistics—despite enabling global trade—has become a major **environmental burden**, especially through road freight. The slide underlines why sustainability, modal shifts, decarbonization strategies, and regulatory pressure are now central themes in modern supply chain management.
