# The image 1 in slide 35 of lecture 14 contains:
The image on the slide shows a branching network diagram shaped like a “T.” At the bottom, a single input stream enters the system, which then splits into several upstream processing branches. As the flow moves upward, it continues to diverge into many possible end-item variants at the top. The visual illustrates how delaying differentiation—keeping the product in a generic form for as long as possible—reduces early variation and pushes customization downstream. This supports the postponement concept: generic inputs are held and processed upstream, while final product variations occur only later, closer to customer orders.
