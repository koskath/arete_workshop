# Slide 20 of Lecture 14 contains information about How much to order? What is the „Economic Order Quantity"

This graph illustrates the core idea behind the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) — finding the order size that minimizes total inventory costs. The horizontal axis represents the order quantity (Q), while the vertical axis shows the cost in euros.
The blue curve slopes downward, representing ordering cost, which decreases as order quantity increases because fewer orders need to be placed. The red curve slopes upward, representing holding cost, which increases with larger order quantities because more inventory must be stored. The black dashed curve is the total cost curve, combining ordering and holding costs. It forms a U-shape: costs fall at first as ordering becomes more efficient, then rise as holding becomes too expensive.
The lowest point of the dashed total cost curve indicates the optimal order quantity—the EOQ—where the trade-off between ordering cost and holding cost is perfectly balanced.
