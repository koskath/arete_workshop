# The image 1 in slide 49 of lecture 14 contains:

The picture on the slide shows a colour-coded map of Northern Europe highlighting the designated **Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs)**. The Baltic Sea and the North Sea are clearly marked as regulated zones, consistent with the timeline mentioned in the text (Baltic SECA from 2006, North Sea SECA from 2007). An arrow points toward the North Sea area, emphasising its inclusion in the stricter sulphur limits. Outside these SECA zones, the waters are shaded differently to indicate where higher sulphur limits applied historically (4.5% before 2012, 3.5% until 2020, and 0.5% from 2020 onwards). The map visually contrasts **strict emission-controlled areas** with **non-regulated waters**, reinforcing how geography shapes environmental compliance obligations for maritime transport.
