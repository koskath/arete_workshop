# Slide 46 of Lecture 14 contains information about Current trends: Three rogue waves End or shift of globalization???

This slide uses a set of symbolic images to illustrate the **three “rogue waves” currently reshaping global supply chains** and raising the question of whether globalization is ending or simply shifting. The large wave image represents turbulence and unpredictability in global trade flows. The EU–US tariff image points to rising **protectionism and trade conflicts**, which disrupt established supply networks. The bear wielding a sanctions hammer symbolizes **geopolitical tensions**, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and broader East–West fragmentation. The digital transformation graphic represents the third major wave: the accelerating **digitization of logistics**, including automation, AI, data-driven supply chains, and platform integration.
Together, these visuals highlight the lecture’s argument that global supply chains are being hit simultaneously by **geopolitics**, **trade policy shocks**, and **technological disruption**—forces strong enough to fundamentally reconfigure how and where firms produce, transport, and source goods. Instead of a simple “end of globalization,” the slide suggests a shift toward more regional, resilient, and digitally enabled supply chain structures.
