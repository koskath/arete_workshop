# Slide 31 of Lecture 14 contains information about Strategic Scope across the total supply chain how to vertically and horizontally align it???

The image presents a matrix that illustrates how different strategic layers must be aligned both **vertically** (within a single company) and **horizontally** (across the entire supply chain). The horizontal axis lists the major supply chain actors—Suppliers, Manufacturer, Distributor, Retailer, and Customer—while the vertical axis lists four key strategy dimensions: Competitive Strategy, Product Development Strategy, Supply Chain Strategy, and Marketing Strategy.

In the center of the matrix, a blue horizontal band highlights the **Supply Chain Strategy** row, showing different possible positions marked “You are here” or “Or here,” indicating that a company can occupy various roles within the chain. Overlaid across the entire matrix is a large red word **“FIT”**, emphasizing that strategic alignment is essential. The message is that all actors in the supply chain, and all strategic layers within each actor, must be coordinated to achieve an effective overall strategy. The diagram communicates the challenge of creating coherence between different organizational functions and between different firms along the supply chain.
