# Slide 7 of Lecture 14 contains information about ... more specifically: identifying „flows“ in the world of business

The chart on the second slide is a visual illustration of how “flows” move through a business system, reflecting the core idea from the first slide that logistics and supply chain management require system, network, and flow thinking. The diagram looks like a simplified organizational structure, but instead of showing only reporting lines, it overlays numerous blue arrows that represent different flows—materials, information, money, decisions, and feedback—moving in multiple directions between departments. The complexity and density of the arrows demonstrate that a business is not a simple linear chain but a dynamic network where units constantly exchange inputs and outputs. The customer placed at the bottom reinforces that all these interconnected flows ultimately converge to serve customer needs. The purpose of the chart is to highlight that effective supply chain management means understanding, coordinating, and managing these interconnected flows across the whole system rather than thinking in isolated functional silos.
