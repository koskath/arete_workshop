# Slide 29 of Lecture 14 contains information about In an upcoming world of modular ecosystems of services around the products

The image illustrates how traditional products evolve into interconnected digital ecosystems, showing the transition from a **product system** to a broader **system of systems** in the context of smart, connected agricultural equipment.

On the left, labeled **4. Product system**, the graphic displays a group of agricultural machines forming an integrated equipment system. This includes tractors, planters, tillers, and combine harvesters, all connected digitally to a central **farm equipment system**. These machines exchange data and function together as a coordinated product family, highlighting how connectivity enhances traditional machinery.

To the right, the image expands into **5. System of systems**, demonstrating how the farm equipment system becomes one node in a much larger, data-driven ecosystem. At the center sits the **farm management system**, which communicates with multiple specialized systems:

- The **weather data system**, fed by sensors measuring rain, humidity, and temperature, and supported by weather maps, forecasts, and applications.
- The **seed optimization system**, linked to seed databases and optimization applications, improving planting decisions.
- The **irrigation system**, connected to field sensors and irrigation nodes, optimizing water usage.
- A **farm performance database**, storing performance data for better long-term decision-making.

These interconnected systems form a comprehensive digital ecosystem in which equipment, sensors, data platforms, and analytical applications work together. The diagram highlights the shift toward smart, modular service architectures that surround physical products, creating new value through integration, data sharing, and advanced analytics.
