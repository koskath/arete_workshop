# Slide 27 of Lecture 14 contains information about MRP 50-60ies - MRP I, 60ies- 80ies MRP II, from the 80ies

The slide illustrates how production planning systems evolved from the 1950s to the 1980s, moving from basic Material Requirements Planning (MRP) to the more advanced Manufacturing Resources Planning (MRP I) and eventually to the integrated Management Resources Planning (MRP II).
On the left, the diagram breaks production management into two major areas: **production planning** and **production control**. Production planning includes the master production schedule, material requirement planning, and scheduling with capacity planning. Production control includes order release and job control. These layers represent the basic logic of early MRP systems, which focused mainly on ensuring that materials were available when needed.
On the right, a more detailed block diagram shows how MRP I and MRP II expand this logic. The core MRP I box includes essential inputs such as the bill of materials (BOM), inventory stocks, lead times, batch sizes, and capacity data. These feed into processes like gross and net requirement planning, requirement optimization, lot-size calculation, and capacity loading. MRP II builds on this by integrating additional functions such as **sales planning**, **business development**, **capacity requirement planning**, **shop floor control**, and the generation of schedules and quantity plans.
The visual progression highlights how MRP grew from a narrow material-planning tool into a comprehensive system that coordinates materials, capacities, schedules, and even broader business functions—laying the foundation for modern ERP systems.
