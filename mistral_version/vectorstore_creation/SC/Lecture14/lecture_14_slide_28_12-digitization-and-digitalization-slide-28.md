# Slide 28 of Lecture 14 contains information about Description of the Image: Core Attributes of Digital Supply Chains
The image breaks down the evolution of digital supply chains into four key attributes—**Digitized**, **Connected**, **Intelligent**, and **Adaptive**—showing how raw data becomes meaningful action. Each attribute is represented as a vertical block with its own color and set of capabilities.
The first block, **Digitized**, reflects the foundation of digital supply chains: the ability to sense, capture, and standardize data. This turns physical events into usable digital data. The second block, **Connected**, shows how this data is combined, filtered, structured, and reported, transforming it into meaningful **information**. The third block, **Intelligent**, highlights advanced capabilities such as visualization, diagnosis, prediction, prescription, and cognitive processing, which together generate **insight**. Finally, the fourth block, **Adaptive**, represents the highest stage, where insights lead to automated or semi-automated **action**—through alerting, matching, orchestrating, automating, or gig-based execution.
Together, the four stages illustrate a progression from raw data to purposeful action, showing how digital technologies enhance responsiveness, efficiency, and decision-making in modern supply chains.
