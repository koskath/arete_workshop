# The image 1 in slide 16 of lecture 14 contains:

The picture on the slide presents a visual overview of the core components of Lean Management, illustrated through a structured diagram resembling the “Toyota Production System house.” At the top, the diagram states the overarching goals of lean: *best quality, lowest cost, shortest lead time, best safety, and high morale*, all achieved by eliminating waste and shortening production flows. Beneath this, the diagram is supported by two central pillars: **Just-in-Time** on the left and **Jidoka** (automation with a human touch) on the right. In between these pillars sits **People & Teamwork**, emphasizing selection, shared goals, ringi decision-making, and cross-trained workers. These key structures rest on a foundation of **Continuous Improvement**, which includes waste reduction tools such as Genchi Genbutsu, the 5 Whys, eyes for waste, and problem-solving. The base of the house displays essential lean enablers: leveled production (heijunka), stable and standardized processes, visual management, and the Toyota Way philosophy. Together, the diagram highlights how Lean integrates cultural principles, technical tools, and process design to eliminate waste, involve everyone, and continuously improve operations.
