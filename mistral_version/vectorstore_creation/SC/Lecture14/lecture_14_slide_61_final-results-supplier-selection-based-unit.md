# Slide 61 of Lecture 14 contains information about Final Results – Supplier Selection Based on Total Unit Cost

The final slide brings together all relevant factors: cost, performance, and policy/CSR considerations. Beyond logistics and operations, this includes:
- **Recycling and CSR alignment:** ABC does not recycle, whereas XYZ complies with recycling and CSR expectations.  
- **“Heroics”:** XYZ has repeatedly supported the buyer during crises, while ABC has not demonstrated the same level of commitment.  
- **Other soft factors:** such as cultural compatibility, relationship history, and supplier reliability.

When these qualitative aspects are added to the earlier cost and performance calculations, the final unit costs become:
- **ABC:** $13.79 per unit  
- **XYZ:** $12.09 per unit  

Although XYZ initially appears more expensive based solely on the quoted price, it ultimately emerges as the **superior supplier** when evaluating all economic, operational, and strategic dimensions. This demonstrates why a **total cost approach** leads to more informed supplier selection decisions than relying on quoted price alone.
