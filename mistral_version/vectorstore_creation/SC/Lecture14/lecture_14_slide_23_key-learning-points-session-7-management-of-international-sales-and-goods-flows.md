# Slide 23 of Lecture 14 contains information about Key learning points: Session 7 Management of International Sales and Goods Flows
Content and literature in this session focus on the management of international sales and goods flows. On the **content** side, topics include the supra‑national legal framework of trade, different levels of economic integration and their link to trade facilitation, what needs to be known for export and import operations, the role of *lex mercatoria* and trade terms, and the basics of international procedural law and the law of sales contracts. The **literature** base is represented by Grainger, A. (2011), “Trade Facilitation: A Conceptual Review” (*Journal of World Trade*, Vol. 45, No. 1, pp. 39–62), and TFG (2020), *Incoterms® 2020 Rules* (Trade Finance Global), which together illustrate how legal and procedural frameworks shape international trade. The **main issues** include economic integration levels—for example, comparing a customs union with a free trade area—customs procedures in the context of the EU, and an overview of Incoterms® covering definition, rules, obligations of buyer and seller and applicability of certain terms. These points lead to several broad questions that address the main issues: **How does economic integration and/or trade facilitation ease international sales and goods flows? How can firms spend less on duties and taxes upon importation to, for example, the EU? Which Incoterm® 2020 is favourable for exporters or importers, and why?** These questions frame the discussion in Final Wrap Up 21.03.2025 Slide 23.
