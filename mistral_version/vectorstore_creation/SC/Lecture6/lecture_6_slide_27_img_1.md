# The image 1 in slide 27 of lecture 6 contains:
The image is a table with the title "Table 3.1 Some of the reasons why companies offshore." It is outlined with horizontal lines at the top and bottom. Inside the table, there are six bullet points listed vertically, each representing a reason why companies choose to offshore. The reasons are as follows:

1. Lower costs in offshore regions
2. Less stringent regulatory controls in offshore regions
3. Deregulation of trade facilitates offshoring
4. Lower communication and IT costs
5. Improving capabilities in many offshore regions
6. Clusters of specific activities (e.g., call centres) emerging in certain regions

The text is aligned to the left, and there are no other visible annotations or visual elements within the table.
