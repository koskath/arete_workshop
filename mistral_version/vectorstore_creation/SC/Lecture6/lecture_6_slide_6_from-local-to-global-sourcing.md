# Slide 6 of Lecture 6 contains information about From Local to Global Sourcing

The image is a structured diagram consisting of five horizontally aligned vertical columns, each labeled with a level from I to V. 

1. **Level Structure**:
   - The top section of each column has an orange arrow-shaped header indicating the level number, labeled "LEVEL I" to "LEVEL V". 
   - Below the level header, each column contains a description outlining purchasing or sourcing strategies:
     - **Level I**: "Domestic Purchasing Only"
     - **Level II**: "International Purchasing Only as Needed"
     - **Level III**: "International Purchasing as Part of Sourcing Strategy"
     - **Level IV**: "Global Sourcing Strategies Integrated Across Worldwide Locations"
     - **Level V**: "Global Sourcing Strategies Integrated Across Worldwide Locations and Functional Groups"

2. **Category Headers**:
   - Levels I through III are under a light olive-green category header titled "INTERNATIONAL PURCHASING".
   - Levels IV and V fall under a darker olive-green category header titled "GLOBAL SOURCING".

3. **Statistics Table**:
   - At the bottom of the image, a table presents statistical data relevant to each level with three rows:
     - The first row is labeled "Currently" and provides percentages: Level I (13.4%), Level II (21.3%), Level III (31.0%), Level IV (18.1%), Level V (16.1%).
     - The second row titled "Future Plans" provides future percentage projections: Level I (7.8%), Level II (7.8%), Level III (14.3%), Level IV (15.6%), Level V (54.5%).
     - The third row labeled "Expected Change" describes anticipated changes in percentage: Level I (-42.0%), Level II (-63.0%), Level III (-54.0%), Level IV (-14.0%), Level V (+239.0%).

4. **Contextual Note**:
   - Below the table, there is text stating, "Percent of companies operating or expecting to operate at a particular level (N=169)".

The layout uses a combination of shapes and colors to differentiate between the levels and their respective sourcing strategies, with clear statistical information provided for analysis at the bottom.
