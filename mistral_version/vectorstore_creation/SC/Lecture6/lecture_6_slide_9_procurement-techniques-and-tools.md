# Slide 9 of Lecture 6 contains information about Procurement Techniques and Tools

Table 9.4 titled "Procurement techniques and tools" is structured in three columns labeled "Method," "Description," and "Benefits." Each column contains text entries aligned horizontally, organized under four different procurement methods. The table has no visible grid lines, showing an open structure.

1. Under the "Method" column:
   - "Request for quotation (RFQ)"
   - "Negotiation"
   - "Formal tender process"
   - "eAuction"

2. Corresponding descriptions under the "Description" column:
   - Request for quotation (RFQ): "Appropriate when the specification is clear and unambiguous and when risk and value are low and there is no real requirement to create unnecessary competition."
   - Negotiation: "Appropriate to negotiate directly with a supplier or contractor when the specification, either/or both technical and commercial, requires some clarification or discussion with a supplier who has more knowledge or information than the customer."
   - Formal tender process: "When the risk and value is high the tendency is for organisations to revert to a formal tender process where a number of suitably qualified candidates will be invited to tender (ITT). The level of formality increases with value and risk."
   - eAuction: "More ‘sophisticated’ approaches would involve electronic auctions (eAuctions), which are appropriate if the category or commodity marketplace is properly researched and understood and there are a number of alternative suppliers who can bid against the defined requirement."

3. Corresponding benefits under the "Benefits" column:
   - Request for quotation (RFQ): "High levels of discretion are possible by informed and experienced buyers."
   - Negotiation: "Customers can have some confidence that they have defined and agreed the specification and scope with suppliers."
   - Formal tender process: "Tender processes create formal competitions that will deliver periodic price and/or cost reductions based on the ability of suppliers to properly define its requirements. Prices can be reduced by 5–20% or higher by using a tender process."
   - eAuction: "eAuctions require the pre-selection of suppliers who can meet the requirements or specifications. They raise higher levels of risk for buyers and suppliers but are associated with delivering up to 30% or more reductions."

The text is aligned neatly in rows, creating a clear visual hierarchy that aligns each procurement method with its respective description and benefits.
