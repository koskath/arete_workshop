# Slide 22 of Lecture 6 contains information about A Framework for Evaluating Potential Outsourcees

The image is a flowchart titled "A framework for evaluating potential outsources." The flowchart consists of various elements organized in a top-down manner with text annotations.

1. **Hexagon (Top):**
   - Text inside: "Outsourcing decision"
   - Two arrows emerge from this shape:
     - Rightward arrow labeled "NO" leading to an oval with the word “Stop.”
     - Downward arrow labeled "YES."

2. **Downward Arrow Path:**

   - **Diamond (First Level):**
     - Text inside: "1. Process to be outsourced 2. Potential outsource"
     - A downward arrow leads from this diamond.

   - **Diamond (Second Level):**
     - Text inside: "Are necessary conditions met?"
     - Rightward arrow leads to a rectangle labeled "Evaluate alternative outsource"
     - Downward arrow continues the flow.

   - **Diamond (Third Level):**
     - Text inside: "Is it a new outsourcing relationship?"
     - A downward arrow connected to a rectangle (fourth level).

3. **Rectangle (Fourth Level):**
   - Contains bullet points:
     - "Level of difference in working environment"
     - "Criticality of outsourced process"
   - A downward arrow leads to the next diamond.

4. **Diamond (Fifth Level):**
   - Text inside: "Approach to managing - outsourced operations - nature of relationship - contingency planning"
   - A downward arrow leads to a rectangle (sixth level).

5. **Rectangle (Sixth Level):**
   - Text inside: "Cost of managing relationship and potential benefit derived from relationship"
   - A downward arrow leads to the next diamond.

6. **Diamond (Seventh Level):**
   - Text inside: "Cost to benefit trade-off"
   - Rightward arrow leads to a rectangle labeled "Evaluate alternative outsource"
   - Downward arrow ends the flowchart in an oval with "Implement outsourcing arrangement."

7. **Additional Elements:**
   - Two small rounded rectangles with text:
     - "Order qualifiers" aligned to the first diamond.
     - "Order winners" aligned to the final diamond.

- The flowchart is presented in a linear sequence with decision points and evaluations, designed to guide the decision-making process in outsourcing evaluation.

- The figure is labeled as "Figure 3.2" with a source citation: "A framework for evaluating potential outsources (Source: Lalwani, Pawar & Shah, 2007)."
