# Slide 35 of Lecture 10 contains information about LSPs versus 3PLs

Considerable overlap between the terminology  
All companies that provide transport/logistics services are LSPs  
LSPs that provide multiple logistics services, often integrated, are third party logistics providers (3PLs).  

Typical 3PL services are:  
• Transportation, customs clearance  
• Warehousing, pick and pack  
• Light manufacturing (e.g. parts assembly)  
• Vendor managed inventory (VMI)  
• Trade financing  
• Managing reverse logistics  
• Parts distribution  
• Inventory management
