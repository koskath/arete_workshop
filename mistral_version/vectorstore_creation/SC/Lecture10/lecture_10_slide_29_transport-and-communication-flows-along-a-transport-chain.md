# Slide 29 of Lecture 10 contains information about Transport and Communication Flows along a Transport Chain

This slide ilustrates the complex network of transport and communication flows that occur along an international transport chain, showing the relationships and information exchanges between all parties involved in moving goods from an exporter to an importer across international borders.At the foundation of the diagram are the physical movement actors arranged in sequential order from left to right. The flow begins with the Exporter or Shipper, who initiates the shipment. The goods then move through a Carrier on Pre-Carriage, which represents the initial transport segment from the shipper's location to the first terminal. This is followed by the Terminal at home, which serves as a consolidation and transfer point in the origin country. From there, the Carrier on Main Haul takes responsibility for the primary transportation segment, typically the longest distance portion of the journey whether by ocean vessel, aircraft, or other long-distance mode. Upon arrival in the destination country, goods pass through the Terminal abroad, another consolidation and transfer point. Finally, the Carrier on Onward-Carriage completes the delivery to the Importer or Consignee at the final destination.Above this physical layer of actors, the diagram shows intermediary service providers who coordinate and facilitate the movement. The Freight Forwarder at home and Freight Forwarder abroad are positioned centrally and highlighted with red circles to emphasize their pivotal coordinating role. Between them sits the Transportation Broker or Agent, who may facilitate connections between the various parties. These freight forwarding entities serve as orchestrators of the entire transport chain, managing documentation, booking cargo space, coordinating transfers, and ensuring compliance with regulations.The customs authorities are represented in the upper middle section of the diagram. Customs at home handles export clearance procedures, while Customs abroad manages import clearance and duty collection. These regulatory entities interact with both the freight forwarders and, when necessary, directly with the shippers and consignees.At the top of the diagram, the Bank of Exporter and Bank of Importer are connected by a bidirectional arrow, representing the financial flows that underpin international trade. These institutions manage letters of credit, documentary collections, and payment transfers that ensure the exporter receives payment and the importer receives title to the goods.The arrows throughout the diagram indicate the direction and complexity of information and communication flows. The freight forwarders show extensive connectivity, with arrows linking them to customs authorities, transportation carriers at each stage, terminals, and the banking institutions. This reflects their role as information hubs, receiving booking instructions, issuing bills of lading, preparing customs documentation, coordinating vessel or flight schedules, and managing the flow of trade documents that accompany physical cargo.The exporter and importer also maintain direct connections with their respective banks, customs authorities, and freight forwarders, though they typically do not communicate directly with all the individual carriers and terminals. This separation of responsibilities allows shippers to focus on their core business while relying on logistics specialists to manage the operational complexity of international transport.
