# Slide 20 of Lecture 10 contains information about Total Distribution Cost Concept

1 Transport Related Costs reflect all costs associated with moving goods, including freight bills, documentation, customs brokerage, etc.  
2 Inventory Related Costs include all other elements of logistics costs – from storing and handling product to write-downs of obsolete or spoiled goods.  
3 Total Distribution Cost = Transport-Related Cost + Inventory-Related Cost.

# Here is what the graph in slide 20 of lecture 9 contains:

- A graph plotting 'Cost per year' on the Y-axis and 'Transportation service' ranging from '100% surface, 0% air' to '0% surface, 100% air' on the X-axis. 
- Three curved lines on the graph:
  - Blue line representing 'Transport-related cost'.
  - Red line representing 'Inventory-related cost'.
  - Yellow line representing 'Total distribution cost (TDC)'.
- A highlighted point labeled 'Minimum TDC' where the yellow line reaches its lowest point.
- Annotations with red hand-drawn circles and labels such as "SEA" near the '100% surface, 0% air' end, and "AIR" near the '0% surface, 100% air' end.
- A section labeled “100% surface, 0% air” describes “Surface captive” commodities that can never bear the cost of air transport (i.e., grain, crude oil, etc.).
- A section labeled “0% surface, 100% air” describes “Air captive” commodities that cannot tolerate the transit time of surface transport (i.e., certain high-value perishables, hot-selling toys, etc.).
- The middle section labeled “Mixture of surface and air” describes transportation service as having “Greater speed and reliability.”
- Additional red handwritten text, arrows, and question marks are drawn over various parts of the graph.
