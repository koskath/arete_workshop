# Slide 43 of Lecture 10 contains information about Financial Flows – Description of the Slide

This slide illustrates how **money moves through the logistics chain**, separating two key financial streams:
- **Red arrows** → *Flow of bills* (invoices being sent)
- **Blue arrows** → *Payment flows* (actual money transfers)

It complements the previous slides on information and physical flows by showing who pays whom, and who invoices whom, when organizing an international shipment.

## How the Financial Flows Work
At the center of the financial network is **Jessica, the Freight Forwarder**, who acts as the financial orchestrator of the entire shipment. She collects money from her customer (the exporter/shipper) and then pays all the logistics service providers involved.

### 1. **Flow of Bills (Red Arrows)**  
These arrows show **who sends invoices to whom**:
- The **Freight Forwarder** invoices the **Exporter/Shipper** for the entire logistics service (transport, handling, documentation, etc.).  
- Jessica receives multiple invoices herself:  
  - from the **Trucker**  
  - from the **Railway Operator**  
  - from the **Terminal at the Seaport**  
  - and from the **Ocean Carrier**  
- Thus, all upstream logistics service providers bill Jessica rather than the shipper directly.
The red arrows highlight that **Jessica consolidates all costs** into one bill for her customer, simplifying the shipper’s financial process.

### 2. **Payment Flows (Blue Arrows)**  
These arrows show **money moving in the opposite direction**, i.e., payments:
- The **Exporter/Shipper** pays Jessica for the full logistics service.  
- Jessica then uses that money to pay:  
  - the **Trucker**  
  - the **Railway Terminal & Operator**  
  - the **Seaport Terminal**  
  - the **Container Depot (if used)**  
  - and finally the **Ocean Carrier**

Blue arrows represent the outflow of funds as Jessica settles all invoices with each service provider.


## Core Insight
This slide demonstrates that financial flows in logistics:
- **Do not follow the physical flow** of goods  
- **Do not follow the information flow**  
- Instead, they follow the **contractual and commercial structure** of the shipment

Jessica, as a freight forwarder, acts as:
- the **single billing point** for the exporter  
- the **central payer** for all logistics providers  

This structure reduces complexity for the shipper while increasing coordination responsibility for the forwarder.
