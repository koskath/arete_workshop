# Slide 22 of Lecture 8 contains information about Manufacturing Supply Chains vs. Service Supply Chains
A manufacturing supply chain creates value through the provision of standardised, repeatable processes that ensure the delivery of freight to the end-customer in a timely fashion. In a service supply chain, standardisation and repeatability are less easy to achieve because customers require more variety and in some cases bespoke solutions.
Services are:
• Less tangible
• More heterogeneous
• More perishable
• Inseparable from the point of consumption
Therefore, service supply chains need to be managed differently than manufacturing supply chains
