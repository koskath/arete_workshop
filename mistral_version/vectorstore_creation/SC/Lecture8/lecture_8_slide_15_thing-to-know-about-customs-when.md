# Slide 15 of Lecture 8 contains information about Thing to know about customs when you do cross-border online shopping
Until recently, goods with a total intrinsic value of no more than 150 EUR were exempt from import duties, and goods with a total value of no more than 10 EUR were exempt from VAT on importation. EU Member States could also grant a VAT exemption for imported goods with a minimum total value between 10 and 22 EUR, according to Council Directive 2009/132/EC of 19/10/2009. As a result, goods were often systematically declared below the VAT threshold (22 EUR) in order to avoid VAT, customs duties and customs formalities.  
Since 15/04/2021, all imported small consignments transported by postal services and express operators by air must be covered by an electronic safety and security declaration and a customs declaration, with a reduced data set for goods with a value of no more than 150 EUR that are not subject to excise duties or restrictions. Since 01/07/2021, all goods imported must be declared and VAT has to be collected, including goods with a value below 22 EUR. The Import One Stop Shop (IOSS) system allows VAT to be collected at the time of purchase and thus enables a faster release at customs; whenever IOSS is not used by the seller or shipper, VAT will be charged at import, although special arrangements for postal services and similar operators are provided.
