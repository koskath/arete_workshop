# The image 2 in slide 27 of lecture 8 contains:

- **Suppliers:**
  - On the left, there are three vertically aligned ovals labeled "1," "2," and "n."
  - Each oval is connected by a solid arrow pointing rightward toward a rectangle labeled "Producers."

- **Producers:**
  - This is a central rectangle positioned slightly to the right of the suppliers. 
  - It has three rightward-pointing solid arrows: one to the "Distributors" rectangle, one to the "Recyclers" rectangle, and multi-dotted arrows pointing toward both "Distributors" and "Collectors."

- **Recyclers:**
  - This rectangle is located below "Producers," connected with a dotted arrow pointing upward to "Producers."

- **Distributors:**
  - Positioned to the right of "Producers."
  - It has five arrows extending to the right into customer sections "1," "2," "3," "4," and "n," labeled as customers, and connected by solid lines.

- **Collectors:**
  - A rectangle placed below "Distributors." 
  - Connected from "Distributors" by a solid arrow pointing downward.
  - It has a multi-dashed arrow pointing leftward to "Recyclers."

- **Logistics Arrows:**
  - At the bottom center of the diagram, there is a horizontally oriented arrow labeled "Forward logistics" pointing from left to right.
  - A parallel dashed line labeled "Reverse logistics" points from right to left.

Each element and connection in the diagram is neatly labeled and organized to depict the flow and interaction between different segments of the logistics system.
