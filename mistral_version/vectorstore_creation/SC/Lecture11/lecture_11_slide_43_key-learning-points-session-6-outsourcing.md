Content:
Key learning points from Session 6, Outsourcing, Offshoring and Procurement in the Supply Chain, bring together content and literature on sourcing and procurement. In terms of content, the session covers sourcing versus procurement, supplier selection and the procurement process, outsourcing versus off‑shoring, the Kraljik Matrix, Total Cost of Ownership, the OLI‑Framework and the Unit Total Cost Approach (UTC). The literature includes Almquist, E., Caleghorn, J. and Sherer, L. (2018): “The B2B Elements of Value”, Harvard Business Review, Vol. 96, No. 2, pp. 72‑81; Kraljic, P. (1983): “Purchasing must become supply management”, Harvard Business Review, Vol. 61, No. 5, pp. 109–117; Trent, R. and Monczka, M. (2005): “Achieving excellence in global sourcing”, MIT Sloan Management Review, Vol. 47, No. 1, pp. 24‑32; and Harding, M. L. (2007): “Gauging total costs, supplier by supplier”, Supply Chain Quarterly, 12/2007.
Main issues:
Some broad questions that address the main issues include “Why do companies outsource and/or go offshore and what is the difference?”, “What are the key components of a procurement process?” and “What criteria may be used to select suppliers and different types of supplier relationships?”. These questions relate directly to sourcing versus procurement, outsourcing versus off‑shoring, and the use of tools such as the Kraljik Matrix, Total Cost of Ownership, the OLI‑Framework and the Unit Total Cost Approach.
