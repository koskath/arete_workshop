This visual represents the final consolidation phase of the ABC Analysis, using the data calculated in previous steps to categorize inventory into three distinct strategic classes. The table features three highlighted columns—marked 5, 6, and 7—that drive this segmentation. Column 5 tracks the "cumulated" physical consumption percentage, while column 6 tracks the "cumulated" value consumption percentage. These cumulative figures allow for the final assignment of a "Class" in column 7. The resulting data clearly illustrates the Pareto principle in action: Class A items (ranks 1 through 7) represent a minority of the physical bulk at only 12.8% of the consumption quantity, yet they generate the vast majority of the financial weight, accounting for 73.5% of the total value. In contrast, Class C items (ranks 11 through 15) make up the bulk of the physical work, accounting for 71.3% of the unit volume, but contribute a mere 10.3% to the financial value. Sitting in the middle is Class B (ranks 8 through 10), which represents a moderate balance, holding approximately 16% of both the physical quantity and the financial value.
