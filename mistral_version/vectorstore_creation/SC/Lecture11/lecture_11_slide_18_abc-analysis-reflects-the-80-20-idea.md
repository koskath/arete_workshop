# Slide 18 of Lecture 11 contains information about ABC-Analysis reflects the 80/20 idea

This graph serves as the visual culmination of the ABC Analysis process, translating the tabular data into a cumulative curve that demonstrates the "80/20 rule" or Pareto Principle within inventory management. The chart plots the cumulative percentage of the total consumption quantity along the horizontal axis against the cumulative percentage of total consumption value on the vertical axis. The resulting curve rises steeply at the beginning, illustrating that a small minority of items—roughly the first 20% on the x-axis—accounts for a disproportionately large share of the value, reaching approximately 75% to 80% on the y-axis. The dashed lines delineate the specific cut-off points between Class A, B, and C, clearly showing how the curve flattens out significantly as it moves to the right; this visualizes how the majority of physical items (Class C) contribute very little to the overall financial value. This graphical verification helps supply chain managers validate their categorization and justifies distinct management strategies, confirming that the most intensive control efforts should be focused on the steep initial section of the curve.
