# Slide 29 of Lecture 11 contains information about Quality Criteria for this type –
What makes a good answer?
The multiple choice
For multiple‑choice questions, the quality criteria for a good answer are somewhat different from those for essay questions. This part of the exam tests your understanding of basic terms and capabilities in the discipline and requires passive knowledge, particularly the ability to distinguish statements that are wrong from those that are right. Accordingly, the main quality criterion is simply the proportion of correct versus incorrect selections. 12.03.2025 Slide 29
