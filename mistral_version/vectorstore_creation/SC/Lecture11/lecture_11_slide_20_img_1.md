This slide presents an alternative inventory classification framework that segments products based on their demand volatility over time rather than solely on their financial value. The graphical component visualizes the total inventory holding cost as a layered structure: the foundation is "Base Flow Inventory," representing "Core business products" with stable, consistent demand; the middle layer is "Wave Flow Inventory," representing "Seasonal fashion products" that fluctuate in predictable cycles; and the top layer is "Surge Flow Inventory," corresponding to "Fad products" which exhibit erratic, sharp peaks in demand. The accompanying table provides detailed characteristics and strategic stockholding policies for each category. "Base flow" items are defined by predictable, high flow rates, allowing for a lean strategy of minimum stock levels and direct deliveries from suppliers. "Wave flow" items, which may be perishable or slow-moving outside of their predictable peaks, similarly rely on minimizing stockholding, with inventory accumulated strictly during peak demand periods. The table further distinguishes "Surge flow" into two specific sub-types: Type 1 items are high-criticality but low-value and physically small with long lead times, necessitating a policy of holding high safety stock levels to buffer against supply interruptions. Conversely, Type 2 items are high-value and bulky but of low criticality; for these, the strategy reverts to minimizing stockholding and building inventory only during peaks or using direct delivery to avoid the high costs associated with storing large, expensive items.
