# The image 1 in slide 25 of lecture 5 contains:
The image depicts a standard normal distribution bell curve centered on a horizontal axis. The horizontal axis is marked with intervals from -3σ to 3σ, labeled as -3σ, -2σ, -1σ, 0, 1σ, 2σ, and 3σ. Below the axis, corresponding numbers -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3 are marked. The x-axis is labeled with the variable "x" on the right end, and below the axis is "t = x/σ".

The bell curve is symmetrically divided into segments between these marks. Each segment's area percentage is labeled as follows:
- Between -3σ and -2σ, the area is labeled 2.15.
- Between -2σ and -1σ, the area is labeled 13.59.
- Between -1σ and 0, the area is labeled 34.13.
- Symmetrically, the same values are repeated on the right side:
  - Between 0 and 1σ, 34.13.
  - Between 1σ and 2σ, 13.59.
  - Between 2σ and 3σ, 2.15.

The entire area under the curve is filled with diagonal lines pointing upwards from left to right. A line with an arrow labeled "P(t)" extends from the top of the bell curve to the peak.

Below the axis, four horizontal arrows are drawn with the following annotations:
- The arrow labeled "50%" spans from -1σ to 1σ.
- The arrow labeled "84.13%" spans from -2σ to 2σ.
- The arrow labeled "97.72%" spans from -3σ to 3σ.
- The arrow labeled "99.87%" spans slightly beyond -3 to slightly beyond 3.

Each arrow is represented by a horizontal line capped with a vertical line on each end, demonstrating the range it covers. The areas covered by these percentages are bracketed together on the right, denoted by a large vertical double bracket.
