# Slide 19 of Lecture 5 contains information about How much to order?


The image, titled "How much to order? What is the EOQ?," provides a complete solution to the inventory problem, defining the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and illustrating the cost trade-off it resolves. The EOQ is the optimal quantity ($Q^*$) that minimizes the total annual inventory cost, which is the sum of the annual holding cost ($H$) and the annual ordering cost ($S$), calculated using the formula $Q^* = \sqrt{(2 \times D \times S) / H}$. For the initial problem with an annual demand ($D$) of 16,000, an ordering cost ($S$) of $\$50$, and an annual holding cost ($H$) of $\$2.50$, the calculated EOQ is 800 units. The accompanying graph visually shows how the total inventory cost is minimized where the Annual Ordering Cost curve (which decreases as order quantity $Q$ increases) intersects the Annual Holding Cost line (which increases linearly as $Q$ increases). Furthermore, the image addresses the hypothetical scenario where demand doubles to 32,000. In this case, the new EOQ is calculated as $1131.37$, demonstrating the principle that when demand doubles, the EOQ does not double; instead, it increases by the square root of two, illustrating economies of scale in ordering.
