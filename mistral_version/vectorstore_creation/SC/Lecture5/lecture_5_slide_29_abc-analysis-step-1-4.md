# Slide 29 of Lecture 5 contains information about ABC Analysis – Step 1-4

The image, titled "ABC Analysis – Step 1-4," provides a table demonstrating the systematic methodology used to classify inventory items based on their economic value to a company, which is the necessary next step for prioritizing actions in an inventory improvement initiative. The analysis begins by calculating the Consumption Value for each article, which is the product of the Consumption (in units) and the Price of the item. This value represents the total annual monetary usage for that article. The next crucial step is determining the Consumption value (in %), which calculates the percentage share of each article's total consumption value relative to the overall value of all inventory items. Finally, a Rank is assigned to each article based on this percentage, from highest to lowest. This process allows management to apply the ABC classification principle, where the items contributing the highest percentage to the total inventory value (the high-priority A-items) are identified, enabling the company to focus its limited resources on forecasting, controlling, and optimizing the small number of items that have the greatest financial impact, rather than wasting effort on the numerous low-value C-items.
