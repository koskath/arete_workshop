# The image 1 in slide 20 of lecture 5 contains:
The image is a diagram titled "Figure 9.5 Periodic system." It is a line graph illustrating inventory levels over time. 

1. **Axes and Labels**:
   - The horizontal axis represents "Time" marked by an arrow pointing to the right.
   - The vertical axis represents "Inventory Level" marked by an arrow pointing upwards.

2. **Lines and Annotations**:
   - A dashed horizontal line near the top labeled "Target Maximum Level (M)" extends across the plot.
   - The inventory level starts at this maximum level, decreases along a diagonal line (downwards and rightwards), then steeply falls vertically.
   - A bracket and arrow along the vertical drop are labeled "I," showing the decrease in inventory from the Target Maximum Level.
   - Diagonal lines (indicating inventory usage) are followed by vertical drops (indicating reorder points).
   - Vertical arrows at each reorder point are labeled "Time of review" pointing downward.
   - "L" represents the lead time, shown by horizontal double-headed arrows between vertical drops and the start of each replenishment in four cycles.
   - "T" represents the time between reviews, shown by horizontal double-headed arrows between the start of each diagonal line.
   - A label "Q = M – I; ordered at time of review, but arrives later" with an arrow pointing from this formula to a point on the graph, indicating the quantity ordered.

3. **Cycles**:
   - The inventory is periodically reviewed, depicted by the four main cycles, each beginning with an inventory review (steep vertical drops) followed by replenishment (beginning of diagonal ascent).

The structure of the graph demonstrates a pattern of inventory consumption and replenishment, showing intervals between reviews and the lead time for orders.
