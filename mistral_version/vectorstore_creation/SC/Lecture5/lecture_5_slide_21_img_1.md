# The image 1 in slide 21 of lecture 5 contains:
The image is a line graph depicting inventory build-up and depletion over time. The vertical axis is labeled "Inventory level," and the horizontal axis is labeled "Time."

1. **Lines and Shapes:**
   - There is a sawtooth pattern with a series of diagonal lines representing inventory changes. The lines slope downward steeply indicating depletion, then sharply upward indicating replenishment.
   - The graph starts from a point above the axis labeled "Reorder Point" and drops down, continuing this pattern throughout.
   - Solid black horizontal and vertical lines form the axes.

2. **Annotations:**
   - "Inventory level" is written vertically, with an arrow pointing upwards along the y-axis.
   - "Time" is indicated horizontally along the x-axis.
   - "Steady drop in inventory level" is labeled with an arrow pointing to the downward sloping part of the line.
   - "Arrival of an order" is labeled with an arrow pointing to the upward sloping part.
   - "Order Quantity, Q" is denoted by a vertical double-headed arrow spanning from the lower to upper sections of the sawtooth peaks.
   - "Safety stock, SS" is written with a double-headed horizontal arrow pointing to a smaller segment at the base level of the inventory lines.
   - "Lead time" is labeled with a horizontal double-headed arrow near the bottom between two vertical lines.

3. **Labels:**
   - The x-axis is not numbered; it is labeled only with the word "Time."
   - The y-axis similarly does not have numeric labels.

4. **Figure Title:**
   - Below the graph, the text reads "Figure 9.2 Inventory build-up and depletion."

The diagram is focused on illustrating the cyclical nature of inventory levels, taking into account reorder points, lead time, and safety stock considerations.
