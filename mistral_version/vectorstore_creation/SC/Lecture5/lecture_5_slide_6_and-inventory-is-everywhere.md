# Slide 6 of Lecture 5 contains information about And Inventory is Everywhere!

The image is a diagram titled "Supply chain pipeline" with the label "Figure 10.1" beneath it. The diagram illustrates the flow of goods in a supply chain, represented as a series of cylindrical shapes connected by lines.

1. **Supplier Finished goods:** 
   - A cylinder labeled "Supplier Finished goods" is positioned on the left. 
   - An arrow labeled "In transit" points right from this cylinder to the next.

2. **Manufacturer Raw materials:**
   - Next to the "In transit" arrow is another cylinder labeled "Manufacturer Raw materials."
   - A line connects downward from this cylinder to a looped path labeled "Manufacturer Work in progress."

3. **Manufacturer Work in progress:**
   - The looped path has three U-shaped bends and is connected to another cylinder on the right labeled "Manufacturer Finished goods."

4. **Manufacturer Finished goods:**
   - A line extends from the "Manufacturer Finished goods" cylinder to the lower right, pointing towards the next element, a cylinder labeled "Distributor warehouse."

5. **Distributor warehouse:**
   - To the right of the "Manufacturer Finished goods" cylinder, the "Distributor warehouse" cylinder is positioned.
   - An arrow labeled "Customer" points upward from this cylinder, indicating the direction toward the customer.

The diagram shows a progression from the supplier through manufacturing stages to the distributor, ultimately targeting the customer.
