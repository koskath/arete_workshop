This image shows a professional business card for Dr. Hans Joachim Schramm, who is a Senior Lecturer at the Institute for Transport and Logistics Management, which is part of the Department of Global Business and Trade at Vienna University of Economics and Business (Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien). The card features the university's circular emblem in the top left corner and displays the text "VIENNA UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS" printed vertically along the left margin.
The card provides complete contact information including the address at Welthandelsplatz 1, D1, 1020 Vienna, Austria, along with a phone number (+43-1-313 36-5981), fax number (+43-1-313 36-716), email address (Hans-joachim.schramm@wu.ac.at), and website (www.wu.ac.at/itl). The design is clean and professional with a white background and black text, following standard academic business card formatting.
Given that this business card appears in a supply chain class presentation, Dr. Schramm is likely either the course instructor, a guest speaker for the class, or his research and expertise in transport and logistics management is being referenced as part of the educational material. His position at a specialized institute focused on transport and logistics makes him particularly relevant to supply chain management coursework.
