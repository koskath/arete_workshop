# Slide 37 of Lecture 5 contains information about Inventory Centralization


The image, titled **"Inventory Centralization,"** explains the principle of inventory reduction through consolidation, often referred to as the **Square-Root-Rule**. This rule states that the **safety stock level needed is proportional to the square root of the number of locations** in the network. The visual proof is provided by contrasting a decentralized system of three distribution centers (A, B, and C) with a centralized system at a single location. In the decentralized scenario, the individual safety stocks needed are 35, 60, and 12 units, respectively. When the inventory is consolidated into a single central location, the total demand variability is pooled, and the required safety stock dramatically reduces to only **62 units**. The calculated reduction is demonstrated by the ratio $\sqrt{1}/\sqrt{3} \approx 0.58$, meaning the required safety stock in the centralized system is approximately **$42\%$ less** than the sum of the safety stocks required in the initial decentralized case of three distribution centers. This exemplifies the benefit of inventory centralization, where demand variability is dampened across a larger pool, significantly reducing the capital tied up in safety stock.
