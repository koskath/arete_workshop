# The image 1 in slide 10 of lecture 5 contains:
The image is a line graph with labeled annotations related to inventory management. The x-axis is labeled "Time," and the y-axis is labeled "Inventory level." 

- The inventory level line comprises several consecutive, downward-sloping, sawtooth-like segments.
- The points where the line slopes downwards reach the x-axis, indicating a steady drop in inventory.
- Points where the line ascends sharply indicate an "Arrival of an order," reverting the line upwards to its starting inventory level.
- A horizontal line approximately halfway up the y-axis is labeled "Reorder Point," intersecting the descending and ascending lines at consistent intervals.
- The segment from the reorder point to the x-axis (the base of sawtooth) is labeled "Lead time," depicting the time from reorder to order arrival.
- Vertical dashed lines indicate significant inventory movements: one at the peak of the sawtooth labeled "Order Quantity, Q."
- A horizontal bracket labeled "Safety stock, SS" is below the reorder point, extending from the x-axis to just below the reorder point line.
- Diagonal arrows touching the descending segments are annotated with "Steady drop in inventory level."

Overall, the diagram visually represents inventory depletion and replenishment cycles, focusing on reordering, lead time, and inventory quantities.
