# Slide 16 of Lecture 5 contains information about Derivation of EOQ Formula (1/2)

Assumptions: Order processing cost are equivalent to setup cost as the total sum of
labor and material cost to produce a product, Large lots reduce setup costs, but small lots reduce inventory, Purchase costs remain stable throughout the year and no discount on bulk purchases is granted.
Purchase costs = p x D
Average inventory level = SS + Q/2
Annual holding costs = (SS + Q/2) H
Number of orders per year = D/Q
Annual order processing costs = (D/Q) S
