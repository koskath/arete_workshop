# Slide 5 of Lecture 5 contains information about A rather messy example…

The image, titled "A rather messy example...," vividly illustrates a massive, disorganized pile of metal parts, likely scrap or salvage from vehicles, filling a storage area where a person is standing atop the heap . In the context of inventory management, this scene represents an extreme case of poor control and unsustainable holding costs. The massive, unmanaged accumulation signifies an excessive amount of inventory, much of which appears to be obsolete (e.g., old car components), thereby tying up capital and demonstrating inefficient asset utilization. Furthermore, the sheer volume and complete disarray lead to prohibitively high non-financial holding costs, as valuable storage space is wasted, and any attempt at retrieval of a specific part would require immense manual effort. Crucially, the lack of any visible organization means that inventory visibility is zero, making it impossible for the supply chain to accurately track or count the stock, which is a fundamental failure to mitigate the "Ugly Tradeoff" between having too much stock and having accurate knowledge of what is held..
