# Slide 24 of Lecture 4 contains information about What could be done? E.g. avoiding overproduction

# The image 1 in slide 24 of lecture 4 is a schematic illustration consisting of two main sections.

**Upper Section:**
- A 3D perspective view shows a person operating machinery.
- The person is positioned next to two machines with control panels.
- Adjacent to the operator is a small stack of boxes labeled “Fertigprodukte” (finished products) and a cart labeled “Wartezeit” (waiting time) with more boxes.
- The text next to the worker can be translated as: “Instruct employees to keep their hands at rest as soon as the production requirement is met.”

**Lower Section:**
- The lower section is a 2D flowchart titled “Montagelinie” (assembly line).
- The diagram begins with three left-aligned shapes: a diamond, a circle with a plus sign, and a circle with a minus sign.
- Arrows lead from these shapes in a left-to-right and right-to-left pattern, indicating a flow.
- Four squares are at the top, two with empty circles, and one with crosses.
- Below, multiple junction points with arrows depict a circular flow, starting and ending with a shape containing stylized arrows pointing in opposite directions.
- An additional text states: “Organize in such a way that overproduction immediately catches the eye.”

The diagram illustrates an organized process with emphasis on the management of production and flow efficiency.
