# Slide 11 of Lecture 4 contains information about Are there other ways to organize production – Basic Layout-types Why, how?

# The table in slide 11 of lecture 4 presents three columns: Criteria for the Organization, Basic Type - Characteristics, and Key Advantage/Key Disadvantage.

The first row addresses the production process criterion. The basic type is identified as Product layout, also called flow shop layout. This layout uses standardized processing operations to achieve smooth, rapid, high-volume flow. It features a linear arrangement of specialized workstations to produce a specific product. The key advantage is that high volume production with unlearned but specialized workers becomes possible. The key disadvantage involves high initial setup costs and setup times, resulting in inflexibility.

The second row covers the machine processes criterion for single tasks. The basic type is labeled as Process layout, also termed job shop layout. This approach groups centers or machines by the process they perform, with departments such as sewing and knitting utilizing more universal machinery. The key advantage is the allowance for different product routings, providing flexibility. The key disadvantage encompasses the need for routing, scheduling, and transportation between single production steps, plus additional setups.

The third row examines the final product criterion. The basic type is described as Fixed Position Layout, where the product or project remains stationary while workers, materials, and equipment are moved as needed. This layout is used in projects where the product cannot be moved. The key advantage is its suitability for big single products or processes conducted one time.
