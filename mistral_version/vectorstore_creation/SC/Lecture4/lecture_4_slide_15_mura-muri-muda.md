# Slide 15 of Lecture 4 contains information about Mura, muri, muda
The concepts of mura, muri and muda highlight different kinds of problems in production systems. Mura refers to “unevenness”, while muda denotes wasteful activities. Muda includes overproduction and early production, for example producing more than customer orders require, producing unordered materials or goods that simply take up space. It also includes waiting and idle time, that is, time when no value is added to the product. Furthermore, transportation waste arises when items are handled more than once, when there are delays in moving materials, or when there is unnecessary moving or handling. Inventory waste refers to unnecessary raw materials in stores, work in process (WIP) and excess finished stocks. Motion waste covers movement of equipment or people that adds no value to the product. In addition, muri denotes overburden or unreasonableness in the way work is organised, and is linked to over-processing, that is, unnecessary processing or procedures carried out on the product that add no value. Finally, defects and repairs represent waste when defective units are produced or scrap has to be reworked. Session 4 - Production and Global Production Networks Slide 15.
