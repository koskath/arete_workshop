2. Centrally, there is another illustration of a similar-looking worker next to two stacks of squares labeled "Halbfertige Teile." Each stack has two layers with four squares per layer on the left, and the right stack is taller with three layers. Between these stacks is the text "Der Grund liegt in der Überproduktion" (The reason lies in overproduction).

3. The right section features another worker who appears to be assembling or sorting items. This worker holds a tool and is surrounded by stacks and scattered rectangular items on the surface. To the right of this worker are two stacks of small rectangular shapes, each with multiple layers.

The bottom of the image contains the text: "Verschwendung durch Überproduktion (Zwischenlager) – der Grund sind Übererfüllung des Produktionssolls und Fertigung in großen Losen" (Waste due to overproduction (intermediate storage) - the reason is over-fulfillment of production targets and manufacturing in large batches).

Overall, the illustration conveys a concept of manufacturing inefficiencies, specifically related to overproduction, with visual demonstrations of partial work and intermediate storage.
