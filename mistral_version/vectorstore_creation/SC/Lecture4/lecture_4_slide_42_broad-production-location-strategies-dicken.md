# Slide 42 of Lecture 4 contains information about Broad production location strategies Dicken

The image contains a 2x2 grid of diagrams, each representing different models of production and supply chain management. The entire grid is divided into four quadrants, two rows and two columns. 

**Top Row:**

- Left Side (Centralized Production):
  - Title on the left: "Centralized Production" in white text on a vertical dark blue background.
  - Top left quadrant:
    - Labeled "Country A" in blue text.
    - Contains a group of four connected small squares in purple, forming a larger 2x2 square.
    - Two black arrows: one pointing right towards "Country B" (top right quadrant), and another pointing diagonally down towards "Country D" (bottom right quadrant).
  - Bottom left quadrant:
    - Labeled "Country C" in blue text.
    - Contains no additional shapes or arrows.

- Right Side (Regional Production):
  - Title on the right: "Regional Production" in white text on a vertical dark blue background.
  - Top right quadrant:
    - Labeled "Country B" in black text.
    - A similar 2x2 configuration of four connected small squares in purple.
    - Four black arrows pointing in each cardinal direction (up, down, left, right).
  - Bottom right quadrant:
    - Labeled "Country D" in black text.
    - Contains a group of four connected small squares, green in color, forming a larger square.
    - Four black arrows pointing in each cardinal direction similar to the top right quadrant.

**Bottom Row:**

- Left Side (Regional Specialization):
  - Title on the left: "Regional Specialization" in white text on a vertical dark blue background.
  - Top left quadrant:
    - Contains a single larger square in purple.
    - Multiple black arrows pointing towards and from the orange square in the top right quadrant, and the green square in the bottom left quadrant.
  - Bottom left quadrant:
    - Contains a single green square.
    - Multiple black arrows pointing towards and from the yellow square in the bottom right quadrant, and the purple square in the top left quadrant.

- Right Side (Vertical Integration):
  - Title on the right: "Vertical Integration" in white text on a vertical dark blue background.
  - Top right quadrant:
    - Contains a single orange square.
    - A black arrow pointing left targeting the large purple square in the top left quadrant.
  - Bottom right quadrant:
    - Contains a single yellow square.
    - A black arrow pointing upwards targeting the green square in the bottom left quadrant.

Each of the four quadrants has a distinct background color: blue for the top left, orange for the top right, green for the bottom left, and yellow for the bottom right. Each quadrant is bounded by a thin black border.
