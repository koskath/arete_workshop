# Slide 22 of Lecture 4 contains information about Lean - A Strategy Based on Lead Time Compression

# The diagram in slide 22 of lecture 4 illustrates the transformation achieved through lean methodology using a before-and-after comparison.
:The upper portion displays the initial process state with blue rectangular segments representing value-adding activities positioned above a baseline, while red segments marked with dollar signs extend below the baseline representing waste activities and their associated costs.

A large blue arrow on the left points toward the waste areas, labeled "Lean Tools to identify and eliminate waste." This arrow indicates the application of lean methodologies to target and reduce non-value-adding activities.

The lower portion of the diagram demonstrates the improved process state after lean implementation. The same value-adding activities are now represented by green rectangular segments positioned above the baseline, maintaining identical widths and positions as the original blue segments. Below the baseline, red segments representing waste have been significantly reduced in size, though still marked with dollar signs to indicate remaining costs.

Three red arrows point from left to right, highlighting the transformation outcomes. The top arrow is labeled "Same Value-Add," indicating that essential value-creating activities remain unchanged. The middle arrow states "Reduced lead time," showing the compression achieved by eliminating waste. The bottom arrow indicates "Reduced costs," demonstrating the financial benefits of waste elimination.

On the left side, text summarizes the overall result: "Shorter lead times, reduced costs, better quality." The visual comparison clearly demonstrates that by maintaining the same value-adding activities while substantially reducing waste, the total process time is compressed and costs are minimized.
