# Slide 12 of Lecture 4 contains information about When doing what? Basic types of layout. Volume vs. Variety

# The graph in slide 12 of lecture 4 presents a two-dimensional graph with Volume on the vertical axis and Variety on the horizontal axis:
Both axes range from Low to High, with Medium marked in the middle of the Volume axis.

In the upper left quadrant, where volume is high and variety is low, the Product Layout, also referred to as Assembly belt, is positioned. This placement indicates this layout type is most suitable for high-volume, low-variety production scenarios.

In the lower left quadrant, where both volume and variety are low, the Fixed Location Layout is situated. This layout type is specifically noted for Buildings and Ships, suggesting its application for low-volume, low-variety production of large stationary products.

In the center area of the graph, at medium volume and medium variety, Hybrid Forms like Group Technology Layout are indicated. This positioning shows that these layout approaches serve as intermediate solutions between the extremes.

In the right side of the graph, where variety is high, the Process Layout is positioned at a lower to medium volume level. This placement demonstrates that process layouts are most appropriate for production environments requiring high product variety with lower to medium production volumes.

The graph effectively illustrates the strategic relationship between production volume and product variety in determining the most appropriate facility layout configuration.
