# The image 1 in slide 43 of lecture 13 contains:
The image depicts a process flow diagram with several components and annotations.

1. At the top left, there is a purple rectangle with a shadow, containing bullet points:
   - "High level of demand uncertainty"
   - "High delivery cost (% to the unit price)"

2. Below this rectangle, there is a horizontal timeline with segments:
   - The timeline starts with a vertical yellow rectangle labeled "Raw Materials" on the left.
   - Arrows pointing upwards along the timeline are followed by labels beneath each segment:
     - "Production"
     - "Assembly"
     - "Manufacturing"
     - "Factory storage"
     - "Automobile dealers"
   
3. At the right end of the timeline, another yellow vertical rectangle is labeled "End customer."

4. Above the timeline, there is a long horizontal black arrow pointing from left to right, labeled "Push."

5. Above the "Push" label, there is a white rectangle with the text:
   - "Demand forecast made on long term forecast"

6. Above the "Manufacturing" section of the timeline, there is a vertical white rectangle labeled "Manufacturing." Attached to it is a horizontal white rectangle labeled "Inventory of finished cars."

7. Two more identical horizontal white rectangles labeled "Inventory of finished cars" are positioned above the "Factory storage" and "Automobile dealers" sections, with upwards-pointing arrows connecting them to the timeline.

The structure visually represents a supply chain progression from raw materials to end customers with an emphasis on inventory and the push strategy.
