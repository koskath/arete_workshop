# Slide 17 of Lecture 13 contains information about SCM – e.g. Simchi Levi’s Key Issues
Simchi‑Levi highlights several key issues in supply chain management and links each **issue** to important **considerations**. Under **network planning**, managers must decide on warehouse locations and capacities, plant locations and production levels, and transportation flows between facilities so as to minimize cost and time. With respect to **inventory control**, they need to ask how inventory should be managed, why inventory fluctuates, and which strategies can minimize these fluctuations. For **supply contracts**, the impact of volume discounts and revenue sharing has to be evaluated, along with pricing strategies designed to reduce order‑shipment variability. When thinking about **distribution strategies**, firms must choose between options such as direct ship versus cross‑docking, determine how many cross‑dock points are needed, and assess the costs and benefits of different strategies. In the area of **integration and strategic partnering**, it becomes crucial to ask how integration with partners can be achieved, what level of integration is best, what information and processes can be shared, and which partnerships should be implemented in which situations. Regarding **outsourcing and procurement strategies**, companies must identify which capabilities are core to the supply chain and which are not, whether product design requires different outsourcing approaches, and how to address risk management. Finally, **product design** raises questions about how inventory holding and transportation costs are affected by design choices, and how product design can enable mass customization. All of these key issues and considerations are brought together in Strategy & Configuration Slide 17.
