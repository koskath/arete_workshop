# The image 1 in slide 42 of lecture 13 contains:
The image consists of a flowchart with annotations and directional elements, illustrating a supply chain concept. Here are the detailed components:

1. **Background and Colors**:
   - The entire image has a white background.
   - "Raw Materials" and "End customer" are shown on a yellow background.

2. **Text Boxes**:
   - A rectangular box at the top with a light purple background containing two bullet points:
     - "Low level of demand uncertainty"
     - "High delivery cost (% to the unit price)"
   - Below, a white box with text: 
     - "Very predictable distribution patterns. Because high level of predictability, orders can be made on long-term forecast"
   - Another white box with text to the right:
     - "Demand forecast made at Store DC"

3. **Main Flowchart**:
   - A horizontal solid black arrow runs from "Raw Materials" on the left to "End customer" on the right, labeled "Push" above it.
   - This arrow starts from a vertical yellow box on the left labeled "Raw Materials."
   - The arrow ends at another vertical yellow box on the right labeled "End customer."

4. **Processes and Arrows**:
   - Below the main arrow are smaller vertical arrows pointing upwards, each positioned under separate labeled text elements:
     - "Production"
     - "Assembly"
     - "Manufacturer DC"
     - "Distributor DC"
     - "Store"
   - The vertical arrows are black, except the one under "Store," which is red and connects to the text box labeled "Demand forecast made at Store DC."

5. **Spatial Layout**:
   - The "Raw Materials" and "End customer" boxes are positioned at the beginning and end of the main horizontal arrow.
   - The section between "Raw Materials" and "End customer" includes labeled processes.
   - The "Push" label is centrally above the main horizontal arrow.

This arrangement visually represents the flow and predictability of a supply chain process with specific focus on demand forecasting at the "Store" level.
