# The image 1 in slide 29 of lecture 13 contains:
The image is a comparison table divided into two main columns labeled "Physically Efficient Process" and "Market-Response Process." There are five rows, each describing different aspects of these processes. 

1. **Primary purpose:**
   - Physically Efficient Process: "Supply predictable Demand efficiently at the lowest possible cost"
   - Market-Response Process: "Respond quickly to unpredictable demand to minimize forced markdowns, obsolete inventories"

2. **Manufacturing focus:**
   - Physically Efficient Process: "Maintain high average utilization rate"
   - Market-Response Process: "Deploy excess buffer capacity"

3. **Inventory strategy:**
   - Physically Efficient Process: "Generate high returns & minimize inventory throughout the SC"
   - Market-Response Process: "Deploy significant buffer stocks of parts or finished goods"

4. **Lead-time focus:**
   - Physically Efficient Process: "Shorten lead times as long as it does not increase cost"
   - Market-Response Process: "Invest aggressively in ways to reduce lead times"

5. **Approach to choosing suppliers:**
   - Physically Efficient Process: "Select primarily for cost & quality"
   - Market-Response Process: "Select primarily for speed, flexibility and quality"

6. **Product design strategy:**
   - Physically Efficient Process: "Maximize performance & minimize cost"
   - Market-Response Process: "Use modular design to postpone product differentiation as long as possible"

The text is organized neatly into rows and columns, with each entry aligning under the respective headers.
