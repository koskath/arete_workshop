# Slide 31 of Lecture 13 contains information about … and consequences on the Network – example – Computer Industry Structure 1985 - 1995
This diagram illustrates the significant structural evolution of the computer industry between 1985 and 1995, representing a shift from vertical integration to a modularized, horizontal supply chain network. Unlike the previous era where single companies controlled the entire production stack, this model segments the industry into distinct functional layers where specialized firms compete independently. At the silicon level, the "Microprocessor" layer is populated by competing component manufacturers such as Intel, Motorola, and AMD, while the "Operating System" layer features distinct platforms from Microsoft, MAC, and UNIX. The supply chain further diversifies into "Peripherals" provided by vendors like HP, Epson, and Seagate, and "Application Software" developed by companies including Microsoft, Lotus, and Novell. Connectivity is handled by "Network Services" providers such as AOL/Netscape and EDS, while the final "Assembled Hardware" layer becomes a competitive arena for manufacturers like HP, Compaq, IBM, and Dell who aggregate these modular components. This horizontal configuration implies that competition occurs within each specific layer rather than across the entire system, allowing final products to be constructed from "best-in-class" components sourced from various specialized suppliers.
