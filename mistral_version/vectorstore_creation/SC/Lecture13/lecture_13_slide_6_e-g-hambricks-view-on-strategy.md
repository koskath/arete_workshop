# Slide 6 of Lecture 13 contains information about E.g. Hambricks View on Strategy
Hambrick’s view on strategy encourages us to ask several key questions. First, we must decide **where we will be active**, and with how much emphasis, which involves clarifying which product categories, which market segments, and which geographic areas we will focus on; together, these choices define the arenas in which we compete. Second, we need to determine **how we will get there**, which means choosing appropriate vehicles such as internal development, joint ventures, licensing or franchising arrangements, and acquisitions, as well as deciding which value‑creation stages and core technologies we will employ. Third, we have to think about **what our speed and sequence of moves will be**, that is, the speed of expansion and the sequence of initiatives, which together constitute the staging of our strategy. Fourth, we must ask **how we will obtain our returns**, considering the underlying economic logic that will allow us to generate profits. Finally, we need to clarify **how we will win**, by specifying our differentiators: for example, whether we will pursue the lowest costs through scale advantages or through scope and replication advantages, or alternatively compete through image, customization, price, styling, product reliability, premium prices due to unmatchable service, or premium prices arising from proprietary product features. All of these elements come together in Hambrick’s comprehensive view of strategy as summarised in Strategy & Configuration Slide 6.
