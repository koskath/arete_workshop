# Slide 16 of Lecture 13 contains information about Competitive Strategy and Supply Chain

Based on the visual content of the slide titled "Competitive Strategy and Supply Chain," the diagram illustrates a hierarchical framework for aligning high-level business goals with operational execution. At the pinnacle is the "Competitive strategy," which dictates the overarching "Supply chain strategy". This supply chain strategy is depicted as a balance between two primary outcomes: optimizing for "Cost" or striving for "Differentiation". This strategic direction trickles down to define the "Supply chain structure," which is composed of six key drivers categorized into two groups. The first group, labeled "Basic Logistical Drivers," includes the physical components of "Inventory," "Transportation," and "Facilities". The second group, labeled "Cross-Functional Drivers," encompasses the integrative elements of "Information," "Sourcing," and "Pricing". The diagram suggests that these six drivers interact—indicated by the central cross-arrow symbol—to physically execute the company's competitive strategy.
