# Slide 22 of Lecture 13 contains information about Strategic Scope of the single actor in the Supply Chain – ONLY some thoughts!
Again considering only some thoughts about the strategic scope of a single actor in the supply chain, we can link **objectives**, **scope**, **concepts**, **chain or function**, **instruments** and **themes** more concretely. For **Supply Chain Awareness**, objectives such as an **efficient supply chain** or a **responsive supply chain** translate into concerns about the **total system**, **total cost**, **transportation flow**, **landed cost**, **batch size** and **EOQ (economic order quantity)**. Under **Supply Chain Configuration**, an “optimal” supply chain involves **global allocation**, designing the **production network**, considering **offshoring**, **factory proximity**, the **micro layout** and layouting, and **vendor relationship management I**, all of which serve as instruments to shape the chain. In the domain of **Supply Chain Execution**, the focus is on **control**, **integration** (both external and internal), avoiding the **bullwhip effect**, enhancing **transparency**, managing **relationships**, improving **visibility**, and deploying IT tools such as **SCEM** (Supply Chain Event Management) and **RFID**. Finally, **Supply Chain Adaptation** involves themes such as **scalability**, **product development**, **adaptivity**, **innovation clockspeeds**, **product life cycles**, **technology assessment**, and **resilience**, all of which determine how the supply chain evolves over time. These linked concepts and instruments are summarised in Strategy & Configuration Slide 22.
