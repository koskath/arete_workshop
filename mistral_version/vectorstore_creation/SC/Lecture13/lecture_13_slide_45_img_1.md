# The image 1 in slide 45 of lecture 13 contains:
The image is organized into several sections with annotations and arrows indicating process flows in a supply chain context. 

- At the top left, there is a rectangular light purple box with two bullet points:
  - "High level of demand uncertainty"
  - "High delivery cost (% to the unit price)"

- Below this box, centered, the text reads: "Many different type of fabrics, colors decided on order."

- The main horizontal section of the image consists of a series of blocks, arrows, and text:

  - On the far left, a vertical yellow rectangle labeled "Raw Materials."
  
  - Along the horizontal line below, starting from the left, is a black horizontal line labeled at multiple points:
    - "Production" beneath the starting point of the line, with a vertical red arrow pointing up to a white box labeled "Made on order."
    - Next, "Assembly" with a vertical black arrow pointing up to the horizontal line.
    - Followed by "Manufacturer DC" with another vertical black arrow pointing up.
    - Then, "Distributor DC" with a black arrow pointing up.
    - Finally, "Store" with the last black vertical arrow pointing up to a white box labeled "Inventory."

  - A horizontal black arrow along the line, labeled "Consolidation of bulky shipments," spans from the "Production" point to beyond "Store."

- On the far right, opposite "Raw Materials," is a vertical yellow rectangle labeled "End customer," pointed to by the end of the horizontal line.

The overall layout is linear, illustrating the flow from "Raw Materials" to "End customer," with points of inventory and ordering processes annotated along the way.
