# Slide 36 of Lecture 13 contains information about This Needs to Be Addressed With the Appropriate Changes in Supply
This slide illustrates the critical need to adapt supply chain designs based on the predictability of demand, contrasting two distinct operational models: the "Efficient supply chain" and the "Responsive supply chain". A graphical cube model demonstrates that high predictability across time, regions, and products favors an efficient approach, while low predictability—characterized by uncertainty—necessitates a responsive strategy. The accompanying table provides a detailed comparison of these two configurations across five key drivers. In terms of value drivers, efficient chains focus on optimizing physical costs like transportation, inventory, and warehousing, whereas responsive chains focus on mitigating market costs such as stockouts, markdowns, and obsolescence. For forecasting, efficient models rely on analytics and baselines, while responsive models utilize heuristics to manage uncertainty. Transportation strategies also differ, with efficient chains utilizing Full Truck Load (FTL) shipments to lower costs, while responsive chains prefer Less than Truck Load (LTL) to prioritize speed. Regarding inventory, the efficient goal is to minimize throughput, whereas the responsive goal is to buffer stock closer to the customer to ensure availability. Finally, sourcing drivers in an efficient chain prioritize quality and cost, while a responsive chain prioritizes quality, speed, and flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions.
