# The image 1 in slide 44 of lecture 13 contains:
The image is a diagram illustrating a supply chain process with the following components:

1. **Heading**: 
   - A purple rectangular box at the top contains two bullet points:
     - "High level of demand uncertainty"
     - "High delivery cost (% to the unit price)"

2. **Flow Diagram**:
   - The main horizontal flow is depicted with a thick black arrow pointing from left to right.
   - On the far left, a yellow vertical rectangle labeled "Raw Materials" is positioned.
   - On the far right, a yellow vertical rectangle labeled "End customer" is positioned.

3. **Components Along the Flow**:
   - Directly beneath the main arrow, starting from the left:
     - "Production" with an upward pointing thin black arrow.
     - "Assembly" with an upward pointing thin black arrow.
     - "Manufacturing" with an upward pointing thin black arrow, above which is a vertical rectangle labeled "Manufacturing" that connects to a larger horizontal box labeled "Demand forecast made on long term forecast". 
     - Above the "Manufacturing" label, there is a smaller rectangle titled "Inventory of finished cars".
     - "Factory storage" with an upward pointing thin black arrow.
     - Above this, another rectangle titled "Inventory of finished cars".
     - "Automobile dealers" with an upward pointing thin black arrow.
     - Above this, another rectangle titled "Inventory of finished cars".

4. **Additional Elements**:
   - A labeled horizontal box spans from "Raw Materials" to "Manufacturing" with the word "Push".
   - The entire structure shows a progression from "Raw Materials" through various stages leading to the "End customer".

Overall, the diagram maps out the supply chain process, highlighting stages like production, assembly, manufacturing, factory storage, and automobile dealers, along with the associated inventories and forecast considerations.
