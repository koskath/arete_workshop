# The image 1 in slide 38 of lecture 13 contains:
The image is a flowchart diagram illustrating a supply chain process, characterized by several elements:

1. **Text in a Purple Box**: 
   - "High level of demand uncertainty"
   - "Low delivery cost (% to the unit price)"

2. **Boxes and Arrows**:
   - There is a rectangular box on the left labeled "Raw Materials" in bold black text on a yellow background.
   - A horizontal black line extends from the Raw Materials box to another rectangular box on the right labeled "End customer," also in bold black text on a yellow background.
   - Along this line, several black arrows point upward, labeled sequentially from left to right as:
     - Production
     - Assembly
     - Manufacturer DC
     - Distributor DC
     - Store

3. **Additional Annotations**:
   - There is a smaller horizontal arrow labeled "Push" below a larger horizontal box that states "Demand forecast made on long term forecast."
   - Three taller, vertically oriented rectangles are labeled "Inventory of finished products" and are spaced along the horizontal line:
     - The first is located between Manufacturer DC and Distributor DC.
     - The second is located between Distributor DC and Store.
     - The third is located between Store and End customer.

4. **Vertical Rectangle**:
   - A vertical rectangle labeled "Manufacturing" in black text is placed between the upward arrows labeled Assembly and Manufacturer DC, directly under the "Demand forecast made on long term forecast" box.

Overall, the diagram visually represents a push-based supply chain model highlighting the flow and locations of inventory.
