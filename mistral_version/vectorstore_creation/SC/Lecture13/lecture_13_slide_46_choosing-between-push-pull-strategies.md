# Slide 46 of Lecture 13 contains information about Choosing Between Push/Pull Strategies
This slide presents a strategic framework for determining whether a supply chain should operate on a "Push" or "Pull" basis. This decision is modeled on a 2x2 matrix defined by two key axes: "Demand Uncertainty" on the vertical axis and "Economies of Scale" on the horizontal axis. The framework suggests that "Pull" strategies are most appropriate in environments with high demand uncertainty and low economies of scale, whereas "Push" strategies are suited for environments with low demand uncertainty and high economies of scale.

The matrix categorizes industries into four distinct quadrants based on these characteristics. The "Computer Equipment" sector, located in the top-left, is characterized by high customization, uncertain demand, and low economies of scale, sitting firmly in the "Pull" territory. In contrast, the "Grocery and Beverages" sector in the bottom-right represents the ideal "Push" environment, defined by stable demand, high economies of scale, and standard processes which are the norm. The "Furniture" industry in the top-right faces a mix of factors, with uncertain demand but high economies of scale, while the "Books and CDs" quadrant in the bottom-left is characterized by low uncertainty and low economies of scale, explicitly noted as a "Push-pull supply chain" scenario. Finally, on the right side, the slide includes a learning exercise asking students to apply this model to other specific industries, including Automobile, Aircraft, Fashion, Petroleum refining, Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology, and Medical Devices, citing Simchi-Levi as the source.
