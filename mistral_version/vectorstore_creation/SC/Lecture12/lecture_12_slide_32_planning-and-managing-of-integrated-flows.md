# Slide 32 of Lecture 12 contains information about Planning and Managing of integrated flows across boundaries is certainly not trivial and not just easy to adjust;

The image is a flowchart illustrating processes in the supply chain involving OEM, System-supplier, and Sub-supplier. The chart is divided vertically into three main sections, each representing different stages and activities characterized by colored backgrounds and distinct icons.

**OEM:**
- Background Color: Light Yellow
- Icons & Annotations:
  - A vertical sequence of icons with arrows connecting them:
    - A red gear icon labeled "Pre-planning Schedule lines" at the top.
    - Followed by a blue box labeled "Body shop."
    - Another red gear labeled "Assembly."
    - A blue box labeled "GR Installation Modules."
    - A red car icon labeled "IR" at the bottom.
  - Horizontal dashed line across the section, intersecting just below the "Body shop" box.
- Horizontal Arrows:
  - From "Body shop" to "System-supplier" labeled "Seq. JIT Preview signal."
  - From "Assembly" to "System-supplier" labeled "Seq. JIT Assembly signal."
  - From "GR Installation Modules" to "System-supplier" labeled "Inbound delivery of modules in sequence" with a yellow square ending in a horizontal dotted line.

**System-Supplier:**
- Background Color: Light Blue
- Icons & Annotations:
  - A vertical sequence of icons with arrows:
    - A document icon labeled "SD-sched.agrmts MRP Purchasing" pointing downward.
    - Vertical dashed line separating "Create seq. JIT call."
    - A box labeled "JIT with sequence."
    - An arrow labeled "GR-Posting," ending in "Delivery / GI."
- Additional Elements:
  - A billing document icon annotated "Billing doc. Invoice verific." at the bottom.
- Horizontal Arrows:
  - "Forecast dely sched./JIT dely sched." pointing from "OEM" entering at the top.
  - From "Delivery / GI" to "Sub-supplier" labeled "Delivery."
  - A thick red arrow labeled "Invoice verific." from Sequence section to "Billing doc."

**Sub-Supplier:**
- Background Color: Light Orange
- Icons & Annotations:
  - A vertical sequence of icons with arrows:
    - A document labeled "SD-sched.agrmts MRP Purchasing."
    - Vertical dashed line below.
    - Two red boxes labeled "JIT-Outbound."
    - A box labeled "Production" with arrows extending horizontally to another box labeled "Calls in sequence."
    - Boxes depicting a sequence labeled "Picking in sequence."
    - Down arrow to "Delivery / GI."
    - Matching icon ending with a "Billing doc."
- Horizontal Arrows:
  - A yellow truck with boxes labeled "Inbound dely of components."
  - Red arrows: 
    - "Receipt of shipping" entering from the left.
    - "Dely confirmation" below entering from the left.

Each section is interconnected and features corresponding labels and icons to indicate sequential operations within each supply chain stage.
