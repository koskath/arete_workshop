# Slide 24 of Lecture 12 contains information about … together with “the trumpet of doom”


## Forecast Error Range over Time

## Here is the Graph Structure in slide 24 of lecture 12

### Axes:
- **Y-axis**: Percentage Forecast Error
- **X-axis**: Time Until Forecast Event (starting from 0)

### Visual Elements:

#### Central Reference Line:
- Horizontal dashed line at 0% error
- Represents perfect forecast accuracy

#### Error Range Cone ("Trumpet of Doom"):
- Cone-shaped area expanding from left to right
- Originates at point (0,0) with minimal width
- Widens progressively as time extends
- Filled with vertical lines indicating uncertainty range

#### Upper Boundary:
- Expands upward from 0% baseline
- Represents positive forecast error (overestimation)
- Increases in magnitude over time

#### Lower Boundary:
- Expands downward from 0% baseline
- Represents negative forecast error (underestimation)
- Increases in magnitude over time

## Flow Characteristics

### Temporal Flow (Left to Right):
- **Near-term (Left)**: Narrow error range, high forecast accuracy
- **Medium-term (Center)**: Expanding error range, moderate uncertainty
- **Long-term (Right)**: Wide error range, high forecast uncertainty

### Error Growth Pattern:
- Error range is minimal at time 0 (present moment)
- Uncertainty increases proportionally with forecast horizon
- Symmetric expansion above and below the 0% centerline
- Creates distinctive trumpet/cone shape giving rise to "trumpet of doom" metaphor

## Key Insight:
The visualization demonstrates that forecast reliability diminishes as the time horizon increases, with uncertainty growing in both positive and negative directions symmetrically over time.
