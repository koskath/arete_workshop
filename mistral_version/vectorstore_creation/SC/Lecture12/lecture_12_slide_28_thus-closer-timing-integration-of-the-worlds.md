# Slide 28 of Lecture 12 contains information about Thus closer timing/integration of the “worlds” of Execution and Planning
# The image in slide 28 of lecture 12 illustrates the integration of execution and planning in supply chain analytics. It shows a two-layer structure with "Planning" and "Execution" as overarching themes. At the top layer, "Planning" is represented by four key processes: Transport, Production, Distribution, and Demand, each linked by arrows indicating flow and interaction.

Below, "Execution" involves practical, operational components such as Sourcing, Master Data, Inventory Management, and Order Processing. Key elements like factories, warehouses, and consumer areas are depicted, connecting these processes.

Arrows labeled "Data" move from the execution layer to the planning processes, emphasizing the role of data in informing and optimizing supply chain decisions. Conversely, "Decisions" arrows indicate how insights from planning impact execution, showing a feedback loop essential for effective supply chain management.

This diagram highlights the critical interplay between data-driven decision-making in planning and tangible actions in execution, illustrating how analytics enhance synchronization and efficiency in supply chains.
