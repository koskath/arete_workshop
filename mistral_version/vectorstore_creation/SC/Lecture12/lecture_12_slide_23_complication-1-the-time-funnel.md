# The diagram in slide 23 of lecture 12 illustrates the concept of the "time funnel" in supply chain management, highlighting the relationship between planning activities, decision-making flexibility, and demand certainty over time. It presents a timeline ranging from years to hours, emphasizing the transition from strategic to operational planning. 

On the left, strategic planning is shown as a large oval representing long-term, broad planning activities focused on parameters of delivery, occurring over years. As time progresses toward the right, the diagram depicts decreasing flexibility and increasing demand certainty. 

The purple boxes represent successive supply chain planning stages:
1. **Master Production Schedule**: A medium-term plan that allocates resources for production.
2. **Material Requirement Planning**: Calculates materials needed to meet production goals.
3. **Scheduling, Capacity Planning**: Short-term allocation and scheduling of resources.
4. **Order Release**: Initiating manufacturing or procurement of materials.
5. **Order/Shop Floor Control**: Immediate execution and management of manufacturing tasks.

These stages transition from strategic to tactical and operational activities, corresponding to decreasing flexibility and increasing certainty.

This visualization emphasizes how supply chain analytics facilitate decision-making at each stage, with data and models increasing precision and efficiency as the timeline narrows from strategic planning to immediate floor control actions.
