# Slide 8 of Lecture 12 contains information about Standard questions of production - Planning and Control
Planning and control of production revolve around some standard questions. First, what is to be produced for whom and by when? This involves forecasting and operations planning, as well as the determination of delivery dates, sales management and lead times. Second, what is needed for this production? Here the focus is on demand assessment, procurement and accounts, including inventory management and stock reservation, supplier selection and the issuing of purchase orders. Third, when is it needed and when should the parts required be generated? This leads to issues of scheduling and loading, such as time scheduling, capacity requirement assessment, capacity loading and order release. Finally, who does specifically what, when and how? This question is addressed through sequencing and monitoring and control, including sequence planning, work allocation and progress control. 12 Digitization and Digitalization 14.03.2025 Slide 8
