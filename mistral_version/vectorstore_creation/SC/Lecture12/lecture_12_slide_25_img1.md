# Slide 25 of Lecture 12 contains information about The image in slide 25 of lecture 12 contains a Planning System Architecture

## Three-Layer Hierarchical Structure

### Top Layer: Advanced Planning Systems (Blue/Purple Shaded Area)
- Labeled as "Advanced Planning Systems"
- Contains "Planning" designation
- Associated with "Strategic decisions" (noted at top right)
- Represents strategic planning level

### Middle Integration Layer
- Three vertical connecting brackets link top and bottom layers
- Shows integration points between systems
- Acts as interface between strategic and operational levels

### Bottom Layer: Enterprise Resource Planning (Dotted Pattern Area)
- Labeled as "Enterprise Resource Planning"
- Associated with "Transactions management" (noted at bottom right)
- Represents operational/transactional level

## Flow Characteristics

### Vertical Integration:
- Three connection points create bridges between layers
- Brackets indicate bidirectional information flow
- Top-down: Strategic decisions flow to operational execution
- Bottom-up: Transactional data feeds planning systems

### Horizontal Flow:
- Arrow pointing left along the top layer
- Indicates planning horizon or process flow direction

### System Separation:
- Clear delineation between strategic (APS) and operational (ERP) levels
- Dotted pattern distinguishes transactional layer from planning layer
- Integration brackets show necessary system coordination

## Right-Side Annotations:
- "Why ar (longer)" - partial text visible
- "To" with associated bullet point
- "Lit" - partial text visible
- These appear to provide additional context about system characteristics

## Key Architectural Insight:
The diagram illustrates a two-tier planning architecture where Advanced Planning Systems handle strategic decisions while Enterprise Resource Planning manages day-to-day transactions, with critical integration points ensuring coordination between strategic and operational levels.
