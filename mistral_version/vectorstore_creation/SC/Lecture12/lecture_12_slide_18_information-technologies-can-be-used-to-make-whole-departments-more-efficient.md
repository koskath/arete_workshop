# Slide 18 of Lecture 12 contains information about Phase 2: IT Support for functional Blocks
In Phase 2, information technologies are used to make whole departments more efficient by providing IT support for functional blocks. The goal here is process optimisation within functional areas such as finance, sales or production. The benefits include higher efficiency of function‑specific processes, and the results are new methods such as IT‑based production planning. However, even though processes within functions are improved, the barriers between functional blocks remain intact. Source: Fleisch, E., Österle, H.
