## Description of the figure in slide 31 of lecture 12

The figure on the left shows two business units: **Supplier** and **Customer**.  
Each unit contains the same internal functions: **Finance**, **Sales**, **Production**, and others (“….”).

Arrows connect matching functions across the two companies:
- Finance ↔ Finance  
- Sales ↔ Sales  
- Production ↔ Production  

These arrows represent **direct electronic data exchanges (EDI)** between functional areas of supplier and customer.

The visual demonstrates **process integration across company boundaries**, showing how information flows can be automated and linked from one firm’s function to the corresponding function of another.  
However, the figure also implies that each function is still somewhat siloed internally—only the inter-company interface is being integrated.
