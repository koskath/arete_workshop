# Slide 16 of Lecture 12 contains information about Capacity requirement planning and – Need for smoothing


## Planning Hierarchy (Left Section)

### Sequential Planning Stages:
1. **Master production schedule** (Gray box at top)
2. **Material requirement** (Gray layered box in middle)
3. **Scheduling, Capacity Order release** (Green box at bottom - Capacity highlighted in red)

## Capacity Analysis Flow (Center to Right)

### Stage 1: Capacity Demand Assessment (Center Section)

#### Required Capacity in h per week (Upper chart)
- Bar chart showing capacity requirements across weeks 1-6
- Varying bar heights indicate fluctuating demand
- Horizontal axis: Time week
- Vertical axis: Hours per week

#### Already Reserved Capacity in h per week (Lower chart)
- Bar chart displaying pre-committed capacity
- Shows weeks 1-6 with variable utilization
- Dashed line at 100% capacity threshold
- Horizontal axis: Time week

### Stage 2: Capacity Smoothing (Right Section)

#### Total Capacity in h per week (Upper chart)
- Bar chart showing total available capacity across weeks 1-7
- Dashed horizontal line indicating 100% capacity level
- Demonstrates uneven capacity distribution
- Horizontal axis: Time week

**Flow arrow (blue)** connects to:

#### Smoothed Capacity in h per week (Lower chart)
- Bar chart showing leveled capacity allocation
- Weeks 1-7 displayed with more balanced distribution
- Dashed line at 100% represents target capacity utilization
- Horizontal axis: Time week
- Result of capacity smoothing process

## Process Flow Direction
Left to right flow showing:
1. Planning inputs (Master schedule, Material requirement, Scheduling)
2. Capacity gap analysis (Required vs. Already reserved)
3. Capacity optimization (Total vs. Smoothed capacity)

The green box (Scheduling, Capacity Order release) feeds into the capacity analysis, which then flows through smoothing algorithms to achieve balanced capacity utilization.
