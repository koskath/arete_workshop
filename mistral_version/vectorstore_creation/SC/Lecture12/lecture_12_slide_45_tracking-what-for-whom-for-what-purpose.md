# Slide 45 of Lecture 12 contains information about Tracking what, for whom, for what purpose?
# Description of the Table in slide 45 of lecture 12: “Tracking what, for whom, for what purpose?”

The table shows the **hierarchy of logistical units**, the **means used to build them**, and how each unit is tracked and identified.  
It helps explain **what level of logistics objects are tracked**, **how they are structured**, and **which identification standards apply**.

---

# 1. Structure of the Table

The table is divided into three main sections:

### **A. Hierarchy and means in building logistical units**
- Shows different levels of units in logistics
- Ranges from transportation units (large scale) down to quantity units (individual goods)

### **B. Logistical units (examples)**
- Illustrates real-world examples of each unit type

### **C. Tracking and Tracing**
- Identifies:
  - What gets tracked at each level
  - Which identification standard is used (e.g., VIN, ISO container number, SSCC)

---

# 2. Hierarchy Levels Explained

## **I. Transportation Unit (TU)**
These are large logistical units used for long-distance movement.

### 1. **Means of transport (active TU)**  
**Means:** Trucks, ships, planes, trains  
**Tracked unit:** Truck in international transport  
**ID standard:** Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)

### 2. **Supporting means of transport (passive TU)**  
**Means:** Container, wagon, swap trailer, trailer  
**Tracked unit:** Container  
**ID standard:** ISO alphanumerical container number

### 3. **Loading device**  
**Means:** Pallets, reusable boxes, load carriers  
**Tracked unit:** Reusable transport boxes  
**ID standard:** GRAI (Global Returnable Asset Identifier)

---

## **II. Load Unit**
These refer to bundled goods prepared for shipping.

### 1. **Packing unit (bundle)**  
**Means:** Parcel, box, pallet, display  
**Tracked unit:** Shipment (e.g., parcels)  
**ID standard:** SSCC (Serial Shipping Container Code)

---

## **III. Shipping Unit**
These relate to individual product units.

### 1. **Sales unit (Article)**  
**Means:** Package, sack, barrel, bottle, can, tray  
**Tracked unit:** Shipment items  
**ID standard:** SSCC or other article-level identifiers

### 2. **Quantity unit (Ware)**  
**Means:** Bulk materials, solids, gases, liquids (transport objects)  
**Tracked unit:** Often tracked via batch or lot codes  
**ID standard:** Varies but typically batch/lot-level identification

---

# 3. Conceptual Logic of the Table

The table communicates several key points:

### **1. Logistics is hierarchical**
From the smallest **quantity unit** → to **sales unit** → to **packing unit** → to **load unit** → to **transportation unit**.

### **2. Different units require different tracking systems**
- Larger transport units (containers, trucks) use global standards like **VIN** or **ISO container numbers**.
- Shipment-level units use **SSCC codes** for parcel tracking.
- Reusable equipment uses **GRAI**.

### **3. Tracking depends on purpose**
- Trucks: traced for fleet management  
- Containers: tracked for global transport routing  
- Packages: tracked for parcel delivery visibility  
- Bulk goods: tracked for quality, compliance, and batch control

# 4. Purpose of the Table

The table answers the question:  
**“What exactly do we track in logistics, and how?”**

It provides a clear mapping between:
- **Logistics object type**
- **Physical examples**
- **Tracking target**
- **Standard used for identification**

This demonstrates how **traceability** supports efficient logistics flows across all levels of the supply chain.
