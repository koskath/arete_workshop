# Slide 15 of Lecture 12 contains information about Scheduling „backwards“ and „forwards“

# The figure 2.7 in slide 15 of lecture 12 displays a Gantt chart titled "FIGURE 2.7 Back schedule based Gantt chart (latest start)."

- **Y-Axis Tasks:**
  - 129 Top handle bracket (1 day)
  - 1118 Top handle coupling (10 days)
  - 457 Top handle (7 days)
  - 019 Blade (11 days)
  - 2142 Scoop (15 days)
  - 118 Shaft (13 days)
  - 048 Scoop-shaft connector (5 days)
  - 082 Nail (1 day)
  - 14127 Rivet (4 days)

- **Bars and Annotations:**
  - Above each task label, there is a horizontal bar representing the task duration.
  - "11495 Bracket assembly (3 days)" is a bar connected to "129 Top handle bracket" and "1118 Top handle coupling," spanning from day 17 to day 19.
  - "13122 Top handle assembly (5 days)" is connected to "457 Top handle," spanning from day 13 to day 18.
  - "314 Scoop assembly (2 days)" spans two bars connected to "019 Blade" and "2142 Scoop," from day 14 to day 16.
  - "1605 Complete shovel (4 days)" spans two bars connected to "13122 Top handle assembly" and "314 Scoop assembly," from day 11 to day 15.

- **X-Axis:**
  - Label titled "Time (days)" marking intervals at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 days.

- **Details:**
  - Each task's duration is highlighted by a thick horizontal bar along the time axis, showcasing start and end times.
  - Arrows indicate dependency and connection between tasks—specifically, tasks feeding into assemblies.

- **Spatial Relationships:**
  - All horizontal bars are aligned parallel to the time axis and are spaced evenly to indicate different sequential tasks. 
  - Tasks are listed vertically, starting with the topmost task (129 Top handle bracket) and ending with the bottommost task (14127 Rivet).


# The figure 2.6 in slide 15 of lecture 12 has the Title: "Gantt chart for cutting approach to snow shovel problem (front or earliest start schedule)"

The chart is divided into multiple rows, each representing a specific task with corresponding time durations. The horizontal axis represents "Time (days)" ranging from 0 to 20, marked with small increments. Each task is represented by a horizontal bar with white rectangles indicating the duration and specific days on which the task occurs. Arrows show the dependency between tasks.

Tasks:

1. **129 Top handle bracket (1 day)**
   - A small bar starting at day 0, ending at day 1.

2. **1149S Bracket assembly (3 days)**
   - A bar starting just after day 1, continuing until day 4.

3. **1118 Top handle coupling (10 days)**
   - A longer bar starting around day 0, extending to day 10.

4. **13122 Top handle assembly (5 days)**
   - Starts after "Bracket assembly" ends, around day 4, and ends at day 9. An arrow points from "Top handle coupling" to this task.

5. **457 Top handle (7 days)**
   - Begins slightly before day 0 and continues to day 7.

6. **019 Blade (11 days)**
   - Starts at day 0 and extends to day 11.

7. **314 Scoop assembly (2 days)**
   - Starts at day 15 and ends at day 17. An arrow points from "Scoop" to this task.

8. **2142 Scoop (15 days)**
   - Starts at day 0 and ends at day 15.

9. **1605 Complete shovel (4 days)**
   - Starts at day 16 and ends at day 20. An arrow points from "Scoop assembly" to this task.

10. **118 Shaft (13 days)**
   - Begins at day 0 and ends at day 13.

11. **048 Scoop-shaft connector (5 days)**
   - Starts at day 0 and ends at day 5.

12. **082 Nail (1 day)**
   - A small bar starting at day 0, ending just after day 1.

13. **4127 Rivet (4 days)**
   - Starts just after day 1, ends at day 5.

The tasks and dependencies are laid out clearly, with visual separation between each bar and arrows indicating task dependencies.
