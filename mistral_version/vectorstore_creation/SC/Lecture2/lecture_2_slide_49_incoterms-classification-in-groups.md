# Slide 49 of Lecture 2 contains information about Incoterms - Classification in Groups
With different rights and duties, the eleven Incoterms (since 2011) are split into four distinct groups. **Group E** covers cases where the goods are made available to the buyer at the seller’s premises. **Group F** covers situations where the seller must deliver the goods to a carrier appointed by the buyer. **Group C** covers cases where the seller must contract for the carriage of the goods without assuming the risk of loss of, or damage to, the goods or additional costs due to events occurring after shipment. **Group D** covers situations where the seller has to bear all costs and risks required to bring the goods to the place of destination.
