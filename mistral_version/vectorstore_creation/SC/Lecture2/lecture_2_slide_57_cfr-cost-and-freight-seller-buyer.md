# Slide 57 of Lecture 2 contains information about CFR – Cost and Freight Seller Buyer
# The image in slide 57 of lecture 2 is a schematic illustration of a supply chain or logistics process, depicted using a series of icons and symbols, organized horizontally across the image. The description follows from left to right:

1. **Leftmost section**:
   - A factory icon with a zigzag roof and a large smokestack. In front of it, to the right, is a smaller building or warehouse.
   - To the right of the buildings is a small stack of containers.
   - Next to the containers, there is a truck facing right, pulling a trailer loaded with containers.

2. **Second segment**:
   - Above this segment, an airplane icon is flying leftwards, drawn in a simplistic style with two wings and four windows.
   - Below, there is a freight train represented by a locomotive pulling two cars loaded with containers.
   - Next to the train, a fuel station icon with a roof supported by columns.
   - To the right of the fuel station are two stacks of containers.
   - A small building or shop with a round sign in front.

3. **Center section**:
   - A port scene with loading cranes and ships:
     - Two cranes are depicted, each lifting a container. The cranes are tall, with rectangular bases and overhead cranes extending above the ships.
     - Between the cranes, there are two ships docked. Each ship has three containers on deck and is marked with an anchor symbol on the side.

4. **Fourth segment**:
   - Similar to the second segment but mirrored:
     - Another crane with a container suspended.
     - A warehouse or similar building with containers stacked to the right.
     - Another small building or shop with a circular sign.
     - A second fuel station similar to the first one.
     - A freight train similar to the first one, moving to the left with containers.

5. **Rightmost section**:
   - Above this section, another airplane icon flies towards the right.
   - Below, a shipping container truck similar to the first, facing right.
   - A stack of containers to the left of the truck.
   - A large two-story building with staggered roofs, reminiscent of a factory or facility. 

6. **Horizontal elements**:
   - Five sets of vertical, dashed lines extend downwards from between sections, creating distinct separations.
   - On the bottom left corner of the image, three horizontal bars with varying shades of blue hover over the ground.

Overall, the image creates a continuous, linear depiction of the supply chain, illustrating various elements of transport and logistics in a stylized format.
