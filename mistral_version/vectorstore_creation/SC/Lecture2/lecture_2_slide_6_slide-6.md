The Stages (Left to Right): Primary Production/Raw Materials - extracting/growing basic materials, Parts/Components - manufacturing components from raw materials, OEM Products - Original Equipment Manufacturers creating finished products, Distribution - getting products to market, Final Use/Consumption - the end customer

The Three Flows (The "S's"): Black S-curves (Product/Service) - Moving LEFT to RIGHT, Physical products flowing downstream through the supply chain, From raw materials → components → finished goods → customer
Red arrows (Information) - Moving BOTH DIRECTIONS, Orders, forecasts, specifications flowing backward. Shipment notifications, tracking info flowing forward, This bidirectional flow is crucial for coordination, Blue arrows (Money) - Moving RIGHT to LEFT, Payment flowing backward through the chain, From customer → distributor → manufacturer → suppliers
