# Slide 59 of Lecture 2 contains information about CIP – Carriage and Insurance paid to Seller Buyer
# The image in slide 59 of lecture 2 is structured horizontally, depicting various stages of a supply chain connected by vertical dashed lines and divided into sections by these lines. 

From left to right:

1. **Left Section**:
   - A factory building with three smokestacks and windows, indicating a production facility.
   - A semi-truck with a trailer loaded with goods, facing right.

2. **Second Section**:
   - Two stackable containers on the ground.
   - Another truck loaded with containers, facing right and moving toward a transport hub.
   - A stylized transport hub depicted with a tall structure topped with a tilted umbrella-like roof.

3. **Third Section**:
   - Another building, smaller in size, possibly a warehouse, with stacked containers to its right.
   - A circular signpost with a line through the center, suggesting it might be a distribution area.

4. **Fourth Section**:
   - Two cranes holding suspended shipping containers, positioned symmetrically, with two cargo ships, each carrying stacked containers, aligned below in water.

5. **Fifth Section**:
   - Another symmetrical set of cranes and cargo ships, mirroring the previous section.

6. **Sixth Section**:
   - Similar to the second section, with a building and containers to the left.
   - A semi-truck and trailer loaded with containers, facing left towards another transport hub with a similar umbrella-like roof.

7. **Seventh Section**:
   - Another transport hub with an umbrella roof.
   - Stacked containers and a building with a circular sign similar to the third section.

8. **Eighth Section**:
   - A train loaded with containers, on tracks, facing right toward a factory structure similar to the first section.

9. **Top Half**:
   - Three airplanes depicted in different sections of the sky, flying from left to right.
   - Two cargo ships, depicted in the air above the cranes and cargo ships, with images of anchor symbols on each.

**Background**:
   - The lower part has a color gradient in three shades of blue, increasing in intensity from the bottom to the top.
  
The repetitive iconography — factories, transport vehicles, cranes, ships, and airplanes — suggest stages in a global supply chain with nodes of production, transport, distribution, and shipping.
