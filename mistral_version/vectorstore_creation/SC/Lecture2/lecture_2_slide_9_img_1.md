# The image 1 in slide 9 of lecture 2 contains:
The top level, labeled supply chain level (global view), shows a simplified view with red arrows indicating flows between gray rectangular shapes. These arrows represent high-level connections and flows across the entire supply chain network.
The middle level, labeled company level (individual view), depicts a more detailed perspective enclosed in a dotted-line box. This layer shows black arrows connecting multiple gray rectangular blocks, representing relationships and flows between different companies or organizational entities within the supply chain. The connections are more numerous and detailed than the global view above.
The bottom level, labeled process level, shows the most granular view with many small rectangular boxes connected by numerous black arrows. This layer is also enclosed in dotted lines and represents the detailed operational processes occurring within and between organizations. The complexity increases significantly at this level, with many more individual process steps and connections visible.
The three levels are connected by vertical dotted lines, suggesting how activities at the process level aggregate up to company-level interactions, which in turn compose the overall supply chain level view.
