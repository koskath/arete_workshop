# Slide 65 of Lecture 2 contains information about The global logistics environment
# The image in slide 65 of lecture 2 contains a circular diagram with three concentric circles:

1. **Innermost Circle**:
   - At the center, there's a small circle labeled "Logistics executive."

2. **Middle Circle**:
   - This circle is divided into six equal segments, each labeled as follows:
     - "Customer service"
     - "Inventory"
     - "Packaging"
     - "Transportation"
     - "Warehousing and storage"
     - "Other activities"
   - The middle circle is titled "Controllable elements," positioned in an arc above the segments.

3. **Outermost Circle**:
   - The outermost ring is also divided into eight equal segments, labeled with:
     - "Political and legal"
     - "Economic"
     - "Competition"
     - "Technology"
     - "Geography"
     - "Social and cultural"
   - The outer circle is titled "Uncontrollable elements," with the label placed as an arc at the top of this circle.

The diagram illustrates the relationship between the logistics executive at the center, the controllable elements in the middle, and the uncontrollable elements on the edge.
