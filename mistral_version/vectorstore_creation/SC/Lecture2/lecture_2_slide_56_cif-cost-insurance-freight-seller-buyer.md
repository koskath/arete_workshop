# The image in slide 56 of lecture 2 depicts a transportation and logistics network involving various modes of transport and infrastructure elements:

Across the top of the image, there are three airplanes evenly spaced, each pointing to the right. Below each airplane, there is a ship carrying cargo containers; all ships are oriented towards the right. Each ship has an anchor symbol on the side.

The ground level is composed of multiple sections from left to right:

1. **Leftmost section:**
   - A factory with a flat roof and two small closed windows. Beside it, a small rectangular building is visible.
   
2. **Second section:**
   - A truck with a trailer carrying five cargo containers, facing right.
   - A road stop area, featuring two sets of stacked cargo containers and a pump station with a hose.

3. **Third section (center-left):**
   - Two cranes are depicted; each crane holds a container suspended above. Below, two ships are docked, each with the same cargo load as the ship image above them.

4. **Fourth section (center-right):**
   - Similar to the second section: A road with a truck and trailer carrying five cargo containers. 
   - A small building with a signpost and stacked containers nearby.

5. **Fifth section (rightmost):**
   - Finally, another factory similar to the leftmost section is found, characterized by a sloped roof and four small windows above.

Throughout the image, vertical dashed lines divide the entire illustration into segments, visually segmenting each of the sections. The background includes horizontal bands of gradient shades of blue on the far left, arranged into four stripes with dark blue at the top fading to a lighter blue at the bottom.
