# Slide 34 of Lecture 2 contains information about „Connecting the dots“ of a Supply Chain
# The image in slide 34 of lecture 2  presents a comprehensive framework for supply chain mapping:
Map 1 illustrates the supply network structure across multiple tiers, showing the progression from Tier 3 suppliers (500 units) through Tier 2 (300 units) and Tier 1, connecting to supply sites and ultimately to Regional Distribution Centers (RDCs) with 50 units, along with various packaging configurations. Map 2 depicts the flow of material and information between key unit operations, displaying a linear process from buying pre-blended materials through raw materials warehousing, processing, filling, secondary packaging, finished goods warehousing, and final distribution to RDCs. Map 3 focuses on the roles, inter-relationships, and governance between network partners, incorporating a replenishment model that connects these operational stages. Map 4 presents the value structure of the product or service through a detailed table covering product modularity, product mix, illustration shows, product life cycle, offering, forecast accuracy and planning horizon, fulfillment process and lead time, product value density versus transport cost, and order cycles. A supplementary text box outlines network governance elements including contracts, relationship types, network roles, intra-firm and inter-firm dynamics, factory networks, supply and R&D coordination, key suppliers and customers, geographic dispersion, and satisfaction measures. The framework is attributed to research by Srai, Jagit Singh and Gregory, Mike on supply network configuration perspectives in international supply chain development.
