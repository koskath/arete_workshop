# Slide 22 of Lecture 2 contains information about Intensified by new Technologies, especially ICT
and new rules of competition
This development is intensified by new technologies, especially ICT, and by new rules of competition. The internet has created a “global village”, and international standards such as GCI replace purely national initiatives. With smart phones in your hand, and with the dissolution of emotional links to local craftsmen, industries or retailers (for example, buying cars on the web), global sourcing of technology and know-how becomes common, such as programmers from India or call centres in Ireland. Industry borders are dissolving.

Examples illustrate the extent of technological change: a birthday card playing “Happy Birthday” contains more computer power than was available in 1950 all over the world, and the average new car contains more computer and electronic circuits than steel. This also underpins the shift from a traditional textile industry to a fashion industry.
