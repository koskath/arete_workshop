# The image 1 in slide 18 of lecture 2 contains:

- The first column begins with a box labeled "Increase Value / Share Price." An arrow leads downward from this box to another box labeled "Increase Operating Margin," from which two arrows extend horizontally to two separate boxes labeled "Increase Revenue" and "Reduce Costs," respectively. The "Increase Revenue" box has two arrows extending to the right into "Price" and "Volume" boxes. The "Reduce Costs" box has arrows leading to four separate boxes labeled "Rent," "Staff costs," "Transport costs," and "Other overhead costs."

- Below these, another arrow extends downward from the "Increase Value / Share Price" box to a box labeled "Reduce Capital." This box has two arrows leading to "Invested Capital" and "Working Capital." The "Invested Capital" box has an arrow pointing to the right toward a box labeled "Property plant & equipment." The "Working Capital" box has arrows leading to "Inventory," "Trade Accounts Payable," and "Trade Accounts Receivable" boxes.

- The second column is titled "Value Levers" in a blue header.

- The third column, titled "Opportunity for Improvement" with a blue background header, contains the following bulleted list:
  - "Extend scope of service offerings"
  - "Increase the amount of value-sharing in contract negotiations"
  - "Improve customer profitability and cross-selling by better understanding customer value"
  - "Opportunity management"
  - "Reduce overhead duplication and maximise asset utilisation by implementing shared services"
  - "Focus on core competencies by out/co-sourcing non-core activities"
  - "Automate and rationalise operational processes"
  - "Improve IT efficiency"
  - "Rationalise facilities"

Each box and label is in a white background with black text, and arrows are black aside from a thick blue arrow that directs attention from the "Value Levers" column to the "Opportunity for Improvement" column.
