# The image in slide 42 of lecture 2 consists of several structured components arranged hierarchically to depict a process. Here's a detailed description:

1. **Main Arrow Diagram (Top Section):**
   - A large horizontal arrow pointing to the right.
   - The arrow is labeled "D1 Deliver Stocked Product."
   - Within the arrow, there are 14 rectangular boxes numbered D1.1 to D1.14, each with specific text:
     - **D1.1:** Process Inquiry & Quote
     - **D1.2:** Receive, Enter & Validate Order
     - **D1.3:** Reserve Inventory & Determine Delivery Date
     - **D1.4:** Consolidate Orders
     - **D1.5:** Build Loads
     - **D1.6:** Route Shipments
     - **D1.7:** Select Carriers & Rate Shipments
     - **D1.8:** Receive Product from Source or Make
     - **D1.9:** Pick Product
     - **D1.10:** Pack Product
     - **D1.11:** Load Product & Generate Shipping Docs
     - **D1.12:** Ship Product
     - **D1.13:** Receive & Verify Product by Customer
     - **D1.14:** Install Product
   - An annotation on the left side says “From Source or Make.”

2. **Lower Section – Hierarchical Decomposition Levels:**

   - Three stacked, downward-pointing triangles.
  
   **Level 4:**
   - Titled "Process Element - D1.2"
   - Contains labeled tasks in smaller rectangles with rightward arrows:
     - "Receive Order"
     - "Enter Order"
     - "Check Credit"
     - "Validate Price"
   - Labeled "Tasks" with an arrow pointing downwards.

     4b. Account rep. refuses credit request.

3. **Annotations:**
   - A blue arrow on the right indicating that "Below Level 3, each process element is described by classic hierarchical process decomposition."
   - Dashed blue lines separate each level, labeled "Level 4", "Level 5", and "Level 6" respectively.

This visual representation organizes the process of delivering stocked products into ordered, hierarchical tasks and activities, providing clarity on the sequence and actions involved.
