# Slide 28 of Lecture 2 contains information about Today’s Topics
Intro: a big picture of internationalization and globalization will be presented, together with the question of the role of logistics and supply chain management within this context. We will ask whether the world is really flat – even without Corona – by discussing the case of Flowers B.V., examining the structure of the supply chain and exploring complications and considerations in the global context of operations. Finally, we will wrap it up by highlighting some key issues in a slightly broader view than that of the case itself.
