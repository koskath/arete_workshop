# Slide 44 of Lecture 2 contains information about The diagram in slide 44 of lecture 2 illustrates three parallel flows that comprise the export order management process.
The Order Flow consists of three sequential stages represented by boxes with orange-highlighted bases, moving from left to right. Below this, the Fulfillment Flow displays three stages with blue-highlighted bases, also progressing horizontally. At the bottom, the Payment Flow shows three stages with purple-highlighted bases following the same directional pattern. Large curved arrows on the left side connect the beginning of these three flows, while similar curved arrows on the right side link the end stages, creating a cyclical relationship between order placement, fulfillment execution, and payment processing. The three-stage structure within each flow represents the sequential progression of activities, with all flows interconnected to form an integrated export order management cycle.
