# Slide 52 of Lecture 2 contains information about EXW - Ex Works

# The image in slide 52 of lecture 2 features a symmetrical arrangement of transportation and infrastructure elements depicting a supply chain:

Starting from the left:

1. **Factory:** 
   - Located on the far left, it has a large building with a chimney and a zigzag roof edge.
   - Adjacent to the factory are three rectangular containers on the ground.

2. **Truck (Ground Transport):**
   - There is a truck facing to the right with three containers loaded onto its flatbed.

3. **Gas Station:**
   - A structure with a canopy and vertical support, suggesting a gas station. Two large rectangular containers sit nearby.

4. **Checkpoint:**
   - A small structure resembling a toll booth or checkpoint with a barrier or sign adjacent to it. 
   - Two containers are placed next to it.

5. **Cranes and Ships (Seaport):**
   - Two identical sections containing cranes and ships.
   - Each section has a crane unloading or loading a container onto/from a ship.
   - Ships are depicted beneath the cranes, each carrying several containers.
   - The cranes are positioned near the large, rectangular ship deck with the ship showing an anchor symbol.

6. **Central Area:**
   - It mirrors the gas station and checkpoint setup but in reverse order, and placed between the two crane and ship sections.

7. **Airplane and Ship (Air and Sea Transport):**
   - Above the ships (above the cranes), two airplanes are flying towards the center; one is positioned over each ship section.
   - Each airplane is depicted with windows and wings, flying left to right.
   - Additional identical ships are on the sea, on opposite ends near the factories.

8. **Factory (Repeated):**
   - Symmetrical to the left side, the same setup of a factory with adjacent containers is mirrored on the right end.
   - A second truck loaded with three containers heads left.

9. **Legend (Bottom Left):**
   - Four horizontal bars represent different shades of blue, indicating a potential legend or key, with no visible annotations or text.

Across the setup, dotted vertical lines extend from the top to the bottom, aligning with each element to divide the sections clearly. The overall illustration encompasses a variety of modes of transportation and logistics elements on a simple flat plane.
