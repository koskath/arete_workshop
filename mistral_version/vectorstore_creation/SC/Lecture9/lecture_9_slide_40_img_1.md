# The image 1 in slide 40 of lecture 9 contains:
The image is a diagram titled "The 'Dell'-case" depicting a timeline and cycle related to supply chain processes. The diagram features a horizontal arrow labeled "Time" pointing to the right. Below the timeline are four vertical dashed lines at points labeled \( t_0 \), \( t_1 \), \( t_2 \), and \( t_3 \). 

- At \( t_0 \), there is an upward vertical arrow labeled "Inventory purchased by supplier."
- At \( t_1 \), there is a downward vertical arrow labeled "Cash paid by supplier."
- At \( t_2 \), there is a downward vertical arrow labeled "Final product delivered to customer."

Above the timeline, there are three horizontal arrows:

1. The first horizontal arrow starts from \( t_0 \) labeled "Supplier inventory period" and continues to \( t_1 \).
2. Above \( t_0 \) and \( t_1 \), there is a dashed line labeled "A/R period X".
3. The second arrow starts at \( t_0 \) labeled "Supplier AP period" and ends at \( t_1 \).
4. From \( t_2 \), two arrows labeled "Dell’s A/R period (negative)" and "Customers’ AP period (negative)" extend outward in opposite directions.
5. "Dell’s A/R period (negative)" extends rightward from \( t_2 \).
6. "Customers’ AP period (negative)" extends leftward from \( t_2 \).

Above the timeline, a vertical gray line at \( t_2 \) is labeled "Production and shipment (= Dell’s inventory period)."
An arrow indicates "Customer usage" extending to the right from \( t_2 \) and ending at \( t_3 \).

Labels and notes include:
- "Suppliers’ C2C-cycle (variable)" with a downward pointer at \( t_1 \).
- "Dell’s C2C-cycle (0 days)" with a downward pointer at \( t_2 \).

Below the timeline are bullet points:
- "Order received from customer"
- "Cash paid by customer"
- "Inventory sold to Dell"
- "Cash paid by Dell *" with a footnote "*Assuming immediate start of production"

The diagram illustrates the flow and timeline of activities and payments related to Dell’s supply chain process.
