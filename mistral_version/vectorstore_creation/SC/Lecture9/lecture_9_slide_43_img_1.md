# The image 1 in slide 43 of lecture 9 contains:
The image contains three main elements arranged horizontally on a white background:

1. On the left side, there is a black silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of the right side and a leaf at the top. The shape is simple and iconic.

2. In the center, the letters "vs" are displayed in a lowercase sans-serif font. The text is black and evenly spaced, serving as a separator between the two logos.

3. On the right side, there is an elliptical blue background shape with the word "SAMSUNG" in white, capital letters. The letters are evenly distributed across the shape and are in a sans-serif font. The ellipse is oriented horizontally and slightly tilted, creating a dynamic appearance. The ends of the letters conform to the curved shape of the ellipse.

The elements are aligned in a straight line, with enough space between each part to distinguish the three distinct components visually.
