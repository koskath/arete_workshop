# Slide 12 of Lecture 9 contains information about Value-Adding Activities

Warehousing should aim to provide value‑adding services as well as to minimise operating costs. The four principal value‑adding activities are, first, creating and breaking bulk consignments in order to achieve better transport economies; second, combining freight, which can be seen as a form of postponement; and third, smoothing supply to meet demand by using buffer stocks, for example in leagile supply chains.

In tihs slide there is also an image which consists of four quadrants, each illustrating a different supply chain concept with labels and diagrams.

**Top Left Quadrant: "Creating bulk"**
- Title: "Creating bulk" located at the top.
- Diagram: 
  - Three identical delivery trucks on the left, each facing right, with arrows pointing towards a building.
  - A single larger truck on the right, also facing right, indicating movement away from the building.
  - The building is centrally located, depicted as a simple rectangular shape with a trapezoidal roof.

**Top Right Quadrant: "Breaking bulk"**
- Title: "Breaking bulk" at the top.
- Diagram:
  - A single large truck on the left, facing right, with an arrow pointing towards a building.
  - Three identical smaller delivery trucks on the right side of the building, each facing right, with arrows moving away from the building.
  - The building, centrally positioned, is drawn similarly to the previous quadrant.

**Bottom Left Quadrant: "Combining goods"**
- Title: "Combining goods" located at the top.
- Diagram:
  - Separated components of a bicycle on the left: a handlebar, bicycle frame, and a pair of wheels with arrows pointing towards the building.
  - A complete bicycle on the right with an arrow pointing right, indicating movement away.
  - A central building, visually consistent with previous quadrants.

**Bottom Right Quadrant: "Smoothing"**
- Title: "Smoothing" at the top.
- Diagram:
  - A stopwatch icon on the top left and top right.
  - An industrial building with smokestacks on the left with an arrow pointing toward the central building.
  - A generic multi-story building on the right, with an arrow moving away from the central building.
  - The central building in the same style as earlier quadrants.

Each quadrant visually signifies different processes in logistics or supply chain management using arrows, buildings, vehicles, and goods.
