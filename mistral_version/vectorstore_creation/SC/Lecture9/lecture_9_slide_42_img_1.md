# The image 1 in slide 42 of lecture 9 contains:
The image is a multi-layered flow diagram displaying relationships between financial concepts, supply chain elements, strategic imperatives, and potential tactical decisions.

**Top Layer:**
- Two rounded rectangles labeled "Net cash inflow from operations" and "Total assets less current liabilities" are positioned at the top left and top right, respectively. "Sales" is present and crossed out within each rectangle.
- Curved braces beside these rectangles are labeled "Cash generation" for the left rectangle and "Asset efficiency" for the right rectangle.
- An "X" symbol sits between the two rectangles, pointing downward with a thick arrow.

**Middle Layer:**
- An oval labeled "Net cash inflow from operations. Total assets less current liabilities" is centrally placed, with the label "Supply chain ratio" to the right.
- The oval has three thick arrows pointing downwards, connecting it to two rectangles: one labeled "Net cash inflow from operations" directly beneath the oval, and another labeled "Total assets less current liabilities" to the right of the first rectangle.

**Lower Layer:**
- Five boxes beneath the rectangles represent "Strategic imperative". Each box is connected by thin arrows pointing upwards to the rectangles above.
  - From left to right:
    - "Operating profit" connects to "Net cash inflow from operations".
    - "Δ Working capital" connects to "Net cash inflow from operations".
    - "Other adjustments" connects to "Net cash inflow from operations".
    - "Fixed assets" connects to "Total assets less current liabilities".
    - "Current assets" and "Current liabilities" link independently to "Total assets less current liabilities".

**Bottom Layer:**
- A bar labeled "Potential tactical decisions" at the bottom contains five boxes with various labels and icons indicating decision tools:
  - "Increased customer intimacy"
  - "Reduce cash-to-cash time" (with a yellow upward arrow pointing to "Δ Working capital")
  - "Outsource" (with a yellow upward arrow pointing to "Other adjustments")
  - "Reduce stock and WIP" (with a yellow upward arrow pointing to "Current assets")
  - "Supplier rationalisation" (with a yellow upward arrow pointing to "Current liabilities")

This structure visually demonstrates the hierarchical link between operational cash flow, asset management, and decision-making processes within the supply chain context.
