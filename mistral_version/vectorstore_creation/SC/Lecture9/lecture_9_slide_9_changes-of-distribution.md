# Slide 9 of Lecture 9 contains information about Changes of Distribution Structures over Time

The image is divided into three horizontal sections, each representing a different decade: the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Each section is split vertically into two categories: "Procurement" on the left and "Distribution" on the right. There are annotations and arrows indicating relationships and processes between different elements in each section.

### 1980s: Rationalization
- **Procurement:**
  - Grey background labeled "Global" and "National / Regional."
  - Five circular icons labeled "Suppliers / Wholesalers" connected with dashed lines.
  
- **Distribution:**
  - Light yellow background labeled "Metropolitan Area" and "Urban Core."
  - A large rectangle labeled "Distribution Centers" connected with black arrows to smaller rectangles labeled "Stores."
  - The labels "Regional supply chains, Warehousing districts" and "Suburbanization, Shopping malls and superstores" under "Procurement" and "Distribution," respectively.

### 1990s: Global Sourcing
- **Procurement:**
  - Grey background labeled "Global."
  - Three circular icons labeled "Overseas suppliers" connected with solid lines.
  - A rectangle labeled "Import Centers" is part of the same sequence.
  
- **Distribution:**
  - Light yellow background.
  - An arrow from "Import Centers" leads to smaller rectangles labeled "Stores."
  - The labels "Global supply chains, Logistics sprawl" and "Suburbanization, Shopping malls and megastores" under "Procurement" and "Distribution," respectively.

### 2000s: Digitalization
- **Procurement:**
  - Grey background labeled "Global."
  
- **Distribution:**
  - Light yellow background.
  - A large arrow labeled "E-fulfillment centers" pointing to various elements.
  - Icons labeled "Parcel hubs," "Sortation centers," "Parcel delivery centers," and "Local depots."
  - Annotations with "Customer home," "Collection point," and "Delivery point."
  - The label "Global supply chains, Logistics sprawl" under "Procurement."
  - The label "City logistics and fast deliveries" under "Distribution."

Each section visually represents an evolution in supply chain and distribution channels through arrows, labels, and color differences between the background and elements.
