# The image 1 in slide 5 of lecture 9 contains:
The diagram illustrates different international sales distribution and sales channel structures involving a "Home Firm" and its connection to the "End Consumer" through various intermediaries such as "Importer" and "Exporter".

1. **Direct Export and Direct Sales**: The first line shows the simplest structure where the "Home Firm" directly exports products to the "End Consumer", bypassing intermediaries.

2. **Direct Export and Indirect Sales**: The second line introduces an "Importer" into the distribution process. The "Home Firm" exports products to an importer, who then sells to the "End Consumer".

3. **Indirect Export and Direct Sales**: The third structure adds an "Exporter" between the "Home Firm" and the "End Consumer". Here, the exporter facilitates the export process, which directly connects to the consumer abroad.

4. **Indirect Export and Indirect Sales**: The fourth line combines both intermediaries—"Exporter" and "Importer". The "Home Firm" utilizes an exporter to ship products, which undergo further importation processes before reaching the "End Consumer".

These structures are crucial for understanding supply chain analytics and management as they highlight different pathways and intermediaries involved in international distribution, impacting cost, efficiency, and control in the supply chain. Analytics can be applied to optimize these pathways, assess performance, manage risks, and understand market exposure.
