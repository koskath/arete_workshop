# The image 1 in slide 23 of lecture 9 contains:
The image shows an arrangement of rectangular boxes stacked in a 3D configuration. The boxes are arranged in a grid-like pattern, consisting of 4 rows, 4 columns, and 3 stacks vertically. Each box is uniform in size, and they are stacked directly on top of each other. 

Annotations include:

1. A double-headed arrow labeled "Free stacking" on the left side, pointing vertically from bottom to top, indicating the vertical arrangement of the stacked boxes.

2. Another double-headed arrow labeled "Depth stacking" on the bottom left, pointing horizontally from the left to the right, indicating the depth of the arrangement.

In the foreground to the right of the stacked boxes, there is a silhouette of a person standing. The person is standing with arms outstretched toward the stack, giving a sense of scale to the arrangement.

The arrangement of boxes forms a rectangular cuboid shape overall, with a total of 48 boxes visible. The boxes are shaded to give the impression of depth and are organized neatly in columns and rows, creating a structured appearance.
