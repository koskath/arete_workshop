# The image 1 in slide 19 of lecture 9 contains:
The image depicts an isometric view of a stacked load on a pallet with distinct packaging components. 

1. **Stacked Load and Pallet**:
   - The stack is a rectangular prism-shaped assembly of uniformly sized boxes or items, tightly packed and aligned with each other.
   - It sits on a pallet, represented at the bottom with elongated, narrow rectangular slats running horizontally.

2. **Corner Boards**:
   - There are corner boards or edge protectors visible at the four vertical edges of the stack.
   - These corner boards are annotated with a text label "Corner Boards" that is positioned to the right of the image with a line pointing to the top-right corner edge of the stack.

3. **Straps**:
   - **Vertical Straps**: Two vertical straps run down the front face of the stack. These straps are uniformly spaced and parallel to the vertical edges of the stack.
   - A label “Vertical Straps” is to the left, with a line pointing to one of the vertical straps.
   - **Horizontal Strap**: There is one horizontal strap visible, circumscribing the stack horizontally around the middle section.
   - A label "Horizontal Strap" appears midway along the right side of the image with an arrow pointing directly to the horizontal strap.

4. **Structural Details**:
   - The boxes are indicated by horizontal and vertical lines forming a grid pattern on the sides of the stack.
   - The top surface is also divided by lines into a grid pattern consistent with the side view.
   - The straps and corner boards serve as reinforcing elements to stabilize the structure during storage or transportation.

5. **Annotations and Spatial Orientation**:
   - The image uses a combination of solid and dashed lines to depict the three-dimensional aspects and hidden edges of the stack.
   - Lines are straight and meet at right angles where they define the edges of the pallet and boxes.

There are no other symbols, colors, or additional structures visible in the image.
