# Slide 10 of Lecture 9 contains information about Conventional versus eCommerce Retail Logistics

The image is divided into two sections: "Conventional Retail Logistics" on the left and "E-commerce Retail Logistics" on the right.

**Conventional Retail Logistics (Left Side):**
- At the top, there is a yellow diamond labeled "RDC" with an arrow pointing down from it. This diamond is connected to a label "Suppliers" on the right and a label "Regional Distribution Center" on the left.
- Below the RDC, a downward arrow labeled "Store Deliveries" points to a large blue circle labeled "Retailer (In store inventory)".
- From this circle, several gray arrows labeled "Travel to store" point downward to a row of six green outlined circles labeled "Customers".

**E-commerce Retail Logistics (Right Side):**
- There is a large rectangular area with rounded corners outlined in blue, inside which are two yellow diamonds labeled "RDC" at the top right. Each diamond has a downward arrow connected to a label "Suppliers".
- Inside the rectangle, there is a smaller blue circle labeled "E-Retailer" to the left. A gray dashed line labeled "Order" leads from "E-Retailer" to a diamond shape below, labeled "Parcel Delivery Company".
- Below the diamond, several gray arrows labeled "Home Deliveries" point downward to a row of six green outlined circles labeled "Customers".
- A dashed line labeled "Online purchases" connects the "Customers" circles to the "E-Retailer" circle.

Both sections depict the flow from suppliers to customers but illustrate different distribution methods—conventional in-store shopping versus e-commerce.
