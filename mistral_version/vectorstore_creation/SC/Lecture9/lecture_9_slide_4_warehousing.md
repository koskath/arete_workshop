This diagram illustrates the extensive physical flow of inventory through a multi-echelon global supply chain, highlighting the critical role of various warehousing nodes in moving products from raw material sources to the final point of sale. The process originates on the upstream side with a complex, tiered network where suppliers provide materials to other suppliers and ultimately to manufacturers. Once production is complete, finished goods enter the logistics network, often starting at a Global Consolidation Centre designed to aggregate shipments from different sources to optimize long-haul transport efficiency. From this central hub, inventory flows downstream into a structured warehousing hierarchy, moving first to Regional Distribution Centres and subsequently to National Distribution Centres. This staged approach allows organizations to strategically position stock closer to specific geographic markets while balancing storage and transportation costs. The final phase of the material handling process involves transferring goods from the national facilities to specific Retailer Distribution Centres, which serve as the "last mile" hubs that break down bulk shipments into smaller, store-ready orders for delivery to individual retailers.
