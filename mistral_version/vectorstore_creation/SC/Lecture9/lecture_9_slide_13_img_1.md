# The image 1 in slide 13 of lecture 9 contains:
The image shows a flowchart with a structure resembling a warehouse or a building, depicted by a simple outline of a roof above three squares and one rectangle, each representing different stages in a process.

1. **Warehouse Structure**:
   - A triangular roof is placed above four connected sections: three squares and one rectangle.
   - The entire structure maintains a linear progression from left to right.

2. **Components Inside the Structure**:
   - **First Square**: 
     - Contains the text "Goods receiving."
     - An arrow enters from the left edge, pointing into the square.
   - **Second Square**: 
     - Contains the text "Put away into storage."
   - **Third Square**: 
     - Contains the text "Order picking & packing."
   - **Rectangle**: 
     - Contains the text "Goods dispatch."
     - An arrow exits from the right edge of the rectangle, pointing outward.

3. **Arrows and Flow**:
   - Arrows connect each stage, beginning from "Goods receiving" to "Goods dispatch," indicating the flow of the process:
     - Arrow from the right of "Goods receiving" to the left of "Put away into storage."
     - Arrow from the right of "Put away into storage" to the left of "Order picking & packing."
     - Arrow from the right of "Order picking & packing" to the left of "Goods dispatch."

4. **Cross-dock Path**:
   - A dotted arrow line runs from "Goods receiving" directly to "Goods dispatch," bypassing the middle two stages.
   - This dotted line is labeled “Cross-dock” in a small rectangle positioned below the dotted path.

Overall, the description provides a clear sequence of processing steps from receiving goods to dispatch, with an alternative cross-docking option directly connecting the beginning and the end stages.
