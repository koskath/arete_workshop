# The image 1 in slide 35 of lecture 9 contains:
The image presents a formula structure related to financial periods and cycles. It consists of textual and symbolic elements organized vertically and horizontally. The layout is as follows:

1. The first line:
   - "accounts receivable (A/R) period" is positioned on the left.
   - An arrow symbol "➔" points to the right.
   - "DSO" is aligned to the right of the arrow.

2. The second line begins with a plus sign "+":
   - "+ inventory period (storage and production time)" follows.
   - The arrow symbol "➔" again points to the right.
   - "+" and "DIH" are aligned to the right of the arrow.

3. The third line begins with a minus sign "−":
   - "− accounts payable (A/P) period" follows.
   - Another arrow symbol "➔" is placed to the right.
   - "−" and "DPO" are aligned to the right of the arrow.

4. A horizontal line runs beneath this text, creating a division before the final part of the formula.

5. The fourth line begins with an equal sign "=":
   - "= cash-to-cash cycle" follows.
   - Another arrow "➔" points to the right.
   - "=" and "C2C" are aligned to the right of the arrow.

The structure uses mathematical symbols to build a sequence that relates different financial periods and calculates a cycle.
