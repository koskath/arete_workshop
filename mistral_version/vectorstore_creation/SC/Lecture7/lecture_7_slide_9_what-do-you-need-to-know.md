# Slide 9 of Lecture 7 contains information about What do you need to know for Export/Import Operations

The image is a flow-style diagram summarizing the key elements that a company must understand when performing export or import operations.  
At the center is a main regulatory block, with six surrounding elements connected by arrows.

## Central Element
**National External Trade Law / Union Customs Code (UCC) / Supranational Agreements**  
This central block represents the core legal framework that governs international trade operations. All other elements feed into or depend on these rules.

## Surrounding Elements

### 1. Sort of Good  
Located at the top of the diagram.  
Refers to the **classification of goods**, typically using CN/HS codes (Combined Nomenclature / Harmonized System).  
This determines how the goods are treated legally and for customs purposes.

### 2. Customs Status of Goods  
Positioned on the right.  
Relates to whether goods are EU goods, non-EU goods, or under special customs procedures.  
Determines how customs authorities handle them.

### 3. Transport Modes, Actors, and Certification  
Bottom-right.  
Covers the method of transport (air, sea, road, rail), logistics partners, and any certifications required (e.g., AEO – Authorized Economic Operator).

### 4. Country of Origin  
Bottom-center.  
Refers to **preferential or non-preferential rules of origin**, which impact tariffs, trade agreements, and customs decisions.

### 5. Countries in Transit  
Bottom-left.  
Deals with **transit procedures**, i.e., the rules applying when goods pass through third countries en route to their destination.

### 6. Country of Destination  
Left side.  
Concerns the final destination country and any **export/import restrictions**, such as sanctions or embargoes.

# Overall Purpose of the Diagram
The image illustrates that successful export/import operations require understanding multiple interconnected aspects — classification of goods, origin, customs procedures, transportation, legal frameworks, and restrictions in both destination and transit countries. All these elements interact through the overarching legal structure (UCC and national trade law).
