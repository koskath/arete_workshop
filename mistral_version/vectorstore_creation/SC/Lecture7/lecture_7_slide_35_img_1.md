# The image 1 in slide 35 of lecture 7 contains:
The image shows a comparison of obligations, risks, and costs between sellers and buyers according to Incoterms 2020, which are a set of international commercial terms. These terms delineate the responsibilities of sellers and buyers in international trade, impacting supply chain analytics in several ways:

1. **General Obligations**: Both parties have distinct general obligations (A1 for sellers, B1 for buyers) affecting compliance and efficiency metrics.

2. **Delivery**: The specifics of delivery (A2 for sellers, B2 for buyers) influence logistics planning and transportation analysis.

3. **Transfer of Risks**: Points of risk transfer (A3 for sellers, B3 for buyers) are crucial for risk management analysis, impacting insurance needs and contingency planning.

4. **Carriage and Insurance**: Responsibilities regarding carriage (A4/B4) and insurance (A5/B5) affect cost allocations and can be analyzed for cost optimization in supply chains.

5. **Documents and Clearance**: Document handling (A6/B6) and clearance processes (A7/B7) require precise tracking and data analytics to ensure smooth customs and regulatory compliance.

6. **Checking/Packaging/Marking**: Obligations related to checking, packaging, and marking (A8/B8) influence quality control metrics and packaging cost analysis.

7. **Allocation of Costs**: Allocation of costs (A9 for sellers and B9 for buyers) directly impacts financial analytics, budgeting, and pricing strategies.

8. **Notices**: Communication requirements (A10/B10) affect lead time analysis and coordination efficiency in supply chain operations.

By clearly defining these obligations, risks, and costs, supply chain analytics can optimize processes, manage risks more effectively, and enhance the overall efficacy of international trade operations.
