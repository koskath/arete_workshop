# Slide 31 of Lecture 7 contains information about Goods Flow, Flow of Property Rights and Financial Flow

This chart visualizes the **three parallel flows** involved in international trade transactions:  
**(1) the physical movement of goods**,  
**(2) the transfer of property rights**, and  
**(3) the corresponding financial flows**.  

The diagram uses three types of arrows to distinguish these:
- **Solid line:** Goods Flow  
- **Dashed line:** Flow of Property Rights  
- **Dash-dot line:** Financial Flow
The interaction takes place between four key actors: the **Exporter**, the **Importer**, their respective **banks**, and the **Carrier**.

## Goods Flow (Solid Line)
At the bottom of the diagram, the exporter ships the goods to the importer through a **carrier** (ship or airplane).  
The path is straightforward:  
**Exporter → Carrier → Importer**, representing the physical movement of the product from the seller’s premises to the buyer.

## Flow of Property Rights (Dashed Line)
Property rights are transferred via the **Bill of Lading (B/L)**, a crucial transport document.  
The sequence is:
1. The exporter hands over the goods to the carrier and receives the **B/L against consignment**.  
2. The exporter then sends the B/L to the **Bank of Exporter**.  
3. The B/L moves from the exporter’s bank to the **Bank of Importer**—either under **documentary collection** or via a **Letter of Credit (L/C)**.  
4. The importer receives the goods **against presentation of the B/L**.
This dashed-line flow shows that ownership of the goods does not transfer simply by shipping; it is formally transferred when the importer presents the B/L.

## Financial Flow (Dash-Dot Line)
The payment cycle follows a financial pathway between the importer, the importer’s bank, the exporter’s bank, and eventually the exporter.
- The **Importer** initiates payment through their bank or issues a **Letter of Credit (L/C)**.
- The **Bank of Importer** sends the L/C or clean payment to the **Bank of Exporter**.
- Once the exporter has complied with the required documents, the Bank of Exporter **credits or releases the L/C** to the exporter.
This flow ensures that payment is secured before the importer gains access to property rights or the goods themselves.

## How the Elements Work Together
The bottom of the diagram includes a curved dotted line labeled **Sales Contract**, representing the underlying legal agreement between exporter and importer.  
The three flows together show how international trade balances:
- the physical delivery of goods,  
- the legal transfer of ownership, and  
- the assurance of payment.  

The chart highlights the **interdependence** between logistics, documentation, and finance in global trade, illustrating how banks, carriers, and traders coordinate to ensure smooth and secure transactions.
