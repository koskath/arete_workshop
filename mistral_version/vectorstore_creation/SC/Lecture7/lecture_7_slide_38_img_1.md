# The image 1 in slide 38 of lecture 7 contains:
The picture on the slide consists of **two horizontal bar charts** placed side by side. They illustrate the results of a 2014 ICC survey on which Incoterms® 2010 rules were most preferred by **sellers** and **buyers**. Each chart ranks the Incoterms based on the number of survey respondents who selected them.
## Left Chart: Incoterms® 2010 Preferred by Sellers
The left chart shows which Incoterms were most commonly chosen by sellers.  
The bars extend horizontally, with longer bars indicating greater preference. The most preferred terms appear at the top:
- **FCA** (Free Carrier) is overwhelmingly the top choice among sellers.  
- **EXW** (Ex Works) and **DAP** (Delivered at Place) follow, showing that sellers tend to prefer terms that minimize their logistical responsibility or give them strong control over domestic handling.  
- Mid-range preferences include **CIF**, **CIP**, **CPT**, and **FOB**, which are common in trade but require sellers to take on more costs or obligations.  
- Least preferred terms among sellers—such as **DAT**, **FAS**, or **DDP**—show very short bars.
The left chart highlights that sellers gravitate toward rules giving them simplicity, control, or lower risk.

## Right Chart: Incoterms® 2010 Preferred by Buyers
The right chart mirrors the left one but shows the preferences of buyers.  
Here, the most preferred Incoterms are different:
- **DAP** is the leading choice for buyers, as it shifts most transport responsibility to the seller.  
- **FCA** also ranks high, showing its general popularity across both groups.  
- Buyers also strongly prefer **DDP**, which places maximum responsibility on the seller—including import clearance.  
- Middle-ranking terms include **FOB**, **EXW**, **CIF**, and **CIP**.  
- The least preferred terms for buyers include **DAT**, **FAS**, and **CFR**.
Overall, this chart shows that buyers tend to prefer Incoterms where the seller handles more transport stages or where delivery is closer to the buyer's location.

## Combined Interpretation
The two charts illustrate a classical tension in Incoterms choice:
- **Sellers prefer terms like FCA and EXW**, which reduce their obligations.  
- **Buyers prefer terms like DAP and DDP**, which increase seller obligations and shift risk away from the buyer.
The visual comparison clearly demonstrates how Incoterms reflect negotiating positions and differing priorities between buyers and sellers in international trade.
