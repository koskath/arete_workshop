The picture on the right side of the slide is a screenshot of the **TARIC Consultation** interface from the European Commission’s *Taxation and Customs Union* website. It shows the online search tool that users access to look up EU tariff and trade-related measures.
The interface is simple and structured. At the top, there is a blue banner with the **European Commission** logo on the left and the title *Taxation and Customs Union*. Below this banner, the interface displays the **TARIC Consultation** section with three main tabs or options: *Measure*, *Geographical area*, and *Regulation*. The visible tab in the screenshot is the *Measure* tab, which includes search fields where users can enter a **goods code (HS/CN code)** or the **country of origin/destination** to retrieve applicable tariff measures. There is also an *Advanced search* option and a link to *Reference Measures*.
The bottom part of the visible interface includes a date indicating the **reference date for the query**, showing when the TARIC information was last updated for consultation. Overall, the picture illustrates the official EU interface used to consult customs tariffs, restrictions, trade defence measures, and other regulatory information integrated into TARIC.
