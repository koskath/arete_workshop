# Here is what the image 1 in slide 22 of lecture 8 contains:

The image contains three side-by-side line graphs. Each graph has a vertical axis labeled "Y" and a horizontal axis labeled "X," both with arrows pointing upwards and rightwards respectively.

1. **Left Graph (Underfitting)**:
   - Title below: "Underfitting".
   - Contains numerous orange square data points scattered above a straight blue line.
   - The blue line is slightly sloped upwards from left to right.
   - The data points are not closely aligned with the line.

2. **Middle Graph (Balanced)**:
   - Title below: "Balanced".
   - Contains orange square data points scattered above and below a smooth, curved blue line.
   - The blue line shows a gentle, concave upward curve.
   - The data points follow the general trend of the line but are not precisely on it.

3. **Right Graph (Overfitting)**:
   - Title below: "Overfitting".
   - Contains orange square data points closely aligned above and below a highly wavy blue line.
   - The blue line has multiple peaks and troughs, showing significant oscillations as it moves from left to right.
   - The line passes very close to almost every data point.

The overall layout is horizontally aligned, with consistent spacing between each graph. The background is a simple white, and the graph lines and axes are prominently drawn in black while the data points remain uniformly colored in orange.
