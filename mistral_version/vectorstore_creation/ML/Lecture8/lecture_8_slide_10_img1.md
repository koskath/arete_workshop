# Here is what the image 1 in slide 10 of lecture 8 contains:

The image contains text and a mathematical formula. 

1. **Text**:
   - The first line reads: "Generate new guess by moving in negative gradient direction:"
   - Following this, there is a formula presented.
   - Below the formula, there are two bullet points:
     - "It decreases ‘f’ if “step size” α⁰ is small enough."
     - "We decrease α⁰ if it increases ‘f’."

2. **Mathematical Formula**:
   - The formula is: \( w^{l} = w^{0} - \alpha^{0} \nabla f(w^{0}) \)

3. **Annotation**:
   - On the right side of the image, underneath the formula, there's a highlighted text block with a yellow background. The text reads: "α = learning rate"

The layout is such that the formula is centered after the first line of text and the bullet points are aligned below it. The highlighted box is aligned with the formula on its right side.
