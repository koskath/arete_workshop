# Here is what the image 2 in slide 10 of lecture 8 contains:

The image contains a line of text with a mathematical expression. The text reads: "Repeat (to successively refine guess):". Following this, there is a mathematical formula: 

\[ w^{t+1} = w^t - \alpha^t \nabla f(w^t) \]

Next to the formula, it states: 

"for \( t = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \)"

The elements are aligned linearly with mathematical notation indicating iterative refinement in optimization, namely involving weights \( w \), learning rate \( \alpha \), and the gradient \( \nabla f(w^t) \). The subscript and superscript notations are used for denoting different iterations and the sequence is expressed with ellipsis to indicate continuation.
