# Here is what the image 1 in slide 30 of lecture 8 contains:

The image is a line graph depicting RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) against Epochs. 

- **Axes**: 
  - The x-axis is labeled "Epoch" and ranges from 0 to 500 with tick marks labeled at intervals of 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500.
  - The y-axis is labeled "RMSE" and ranges from 0.5 to 3.5 with tick marks labeled at intervals of 0.5, starting from 1.0 up to 3.5.

- **Lines**:
  - A bold blue solid line represents the "Validation set" and starts high near 3.5 on the y-axis, decreasing until around epoch 200, then slightly increasing again.
  - A red dashed line represents the "Training set" and starts near 3.0 on the y-axis, decreasing steadily to below 1.0 by around epoch 200, then slightly levels off.
  - A horizontal black dotted line is at y = 1.0 across the entire x-axis.

- **Annotation**:
  - The phrase "Best model" is placed near the middle of the graph between epochs 200 and 300, slightly above the black dotted line.
  - A bold black arrow points down from the "Best model" text to the intersection of the blue line and the black dotted line.

- **Legend**:
  - Located in the top-right corner, having two entries:
    - A blue solid line labeled "Validation set."
    - A red dashed line labeled "Training set." 

The graph is enclosed within a rectangular frame.
