# Here is what the image 1 in slide 32 of lecture 8 contains:

The image presents a neural network diagram highlighting the concept of dropout. 

- **Structure:**
  - The diagram consists of three layers of nodes.
  - The input layer has three nodes arranged horizontally, labeled from left to right as "1," "x1", and "x2."
  - The first node in the input layer is colored light yellow, labeled "1."
  - The second node is marked with an "x1" label below.
  - The third node is marked "x2" below it and colored in light green.

- **Hidden Layer:**
  - This layer contains five nodes arranged horizontally.
  - The nodes are round and light blue.
  - Three nodes in this layer are marked with large red "X"s over them. The first, third, and fifth nodes (from left to right) contain the Xs.
  - A red arrow labeled "Dropped" points to the rightmost node in this layer.

- **Output Layer:**
  - Contains four nodes arranged horizontally at the top.
  - All nodes are light blue circles.
  - They are connected to the hidden layer with gray solid lines pointing upwards.

- **Connections:**
  - Solid gray arrows indicate active connections between nodes.
  - Dashed gray arrows indicate potential connections to dropped nodes.

- **Special Annotations:**
  - The text "Dropped" in red is associated with the nodes in the hidden layer marked with red "X"s.
  
- **Other Features:**
  - The layout of the connections illustrates a feedforward network, with inputs at the bottom, processing in the hidden layer, and outputs at the top.
