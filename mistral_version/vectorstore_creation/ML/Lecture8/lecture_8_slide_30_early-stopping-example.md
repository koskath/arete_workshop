# Slide 30 of Lecture 8 contains information about the Early Stopping Example.

This example shows a high-degree Polynomial Regression model being trained with Gradient Descent. Validation Data is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on training data. As epochs go by, the algorithm learns, and its prediction error (RMSE) on the training set goes down. The prediction error on the validation set is also going down.
