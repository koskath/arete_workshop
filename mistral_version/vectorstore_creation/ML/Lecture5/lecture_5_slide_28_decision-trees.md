# Slide 28 of Lecture 5 contains information about the Decision Trees.

Decision trees can perform classification, regression, and even multi-output tasks by approximating discrete-valued target functions for inductive inference, and they are robust to noisy data, capable of learning disjunctive expressions, fitting complex datasets, and leading to decisions through a sequence of if/else questions that estimate relationships between outcome variables and one or more independent variables.
