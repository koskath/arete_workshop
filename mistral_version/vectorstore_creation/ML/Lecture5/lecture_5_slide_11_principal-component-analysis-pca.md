# Slide 11 of Lecture 5 contains information about the Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

PCA reduces dimensionality by exposing underlying structure in datasets in an unsupervised way, explaining most of the variability with a smaller number of variables by identifying the axis that accounts for the largest variance in the training set, rotating the dataset to obtain statistically uncorrelated features, and then selecting a subset of these new features based on their importance.
