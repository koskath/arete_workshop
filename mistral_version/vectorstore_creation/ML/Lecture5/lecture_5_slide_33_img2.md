# Here is what the image 2 in slide 33 of lecture 5 contains:

The image is a diagram of a decision tree structure. It consists of various nodes and annotations, organized in a structured format:

1. **Root Node**:
   - Located at the top of the diagram.
   - Represented by a blue, rounded rectangle labeled "ROOT Node."
   - An arrow labeled "Splitting" points downward to the first layer of decision nodes.

2. **First Layer**:
   - Consists of one "Decision Node" located to the left, colored in light orange.
   - Connected to "ROOT Node" via a downward arrow.

3. **Second Layer**:
   - Two "Decision Nodes" connected with lines from the "Decision Node" in the first layer.
   - The left "Decision Node" in this layer leads to two "Terminal Nodes" below it.
   - The right "Decision Node" leads to one "Terminal Node" directly below it.

4. **Terminal Nodes**:
   - Three green, rounded rectangles labeled "Terminal Node."
   - Two are connected to the left "Decision Node" of the second layer.
   - One is connected to the right "Decision Node" of the second layer.

5. **Branch/Sub-Tree**:
   - Located to the right of the main structure inside a dashed rectangle.
   - Label "Branch/Sub-Tree" with a downward arrow pointing to the rectangle.
   - Inside, there's one "Decision Node" labeled "A" in light orange near the top.
   - Below it, two green "Terminal Nodes" labeled "B" and "C."
   - Lines connect "A" to both "B" and "C."

6. **Annotations**:
   - In the lower-left corner, in bold, is "Note: A is parent node of B and C."

The entire tree structure is contained within a blue dashed rectangle with small dotted background, creating a clear distinction between segments of the tree.
