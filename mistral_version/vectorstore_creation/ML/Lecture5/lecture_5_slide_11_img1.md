# Here is what the image 1 in slide 11 of lecture 5 contains:

The image is a scatter plot chart titled "Original data," displaying two primary axes. The horizontal axis is labeled "feature 1" with values ranging from -8 to 4, marked at increments of 2. The vertical axis is labeled "feature 2" with values ranging from -8 to 4, similarly marked. 

The data points are scattered over the plot and exhibit a clear diagonal pattern from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting a negative correlation between "feature 1" and "feature 2." The points are color-coded, transitioning from dark purple to blue to green, and finally to yellow as they move along the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right. 

There are two labeled components: 
1. "Component 1," which is marked by a large black arrow originating near the center of the plot and pointing towards the right-bottom direction.
2. "Component 2," marked by a smaller black arrow, perpendicular to "Component 1," starting near the same origin and pointing towards the top-left direction.

Both component labels are in black text, with "Component 1" positioned to the left of the larger arrow and "Component 2" above the smaller arrow. The grid within the plot provides guidance for evaluating the position of the individual points along the axes.
