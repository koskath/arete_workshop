# Slide 29 of Lecture 5 contains information about the Decision Trees.

A decision tree searches a completely expressive hypothesis space in which each path from the root to a leaf represents a conjunction of attribute-value constraints, the entire tree corresponds to a disjunction of these conjunctions, and the learned function for a classification problem is represented by this tree structure.
