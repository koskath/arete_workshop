# Here is what the image 2 in slide 43 of lecture 5 contains:

The image is divided into two main sections, each featuring a conceptual diagram. 

Left Section (Bagging):
- Background color is bright magenta.
- At the top, the word "bagging" is in lowercase white text.
- Inside a white dashed rectangular border are three vertically stacked, identical graphical representations.
- Each representation consists of a white circle containing a small, stylized icon resembling squares connected by lines, with an arrow pointing to the right.
- Three arrows labeled "e1", "e2", and "eN" in white text point rightwards from the center of the icons to denote the outputs.
- Below the icons, a green rectangle contains a white mathematical formula: 

   e = (1/N) Σ (from i=1 to N) e_i

- At the bottom of the section, "simple average" is written in lowercase white text.

Right Section (Boosting):
- Background color is dark purple.
- At the top, the word "boosting" is in lowercase white text.
- Similar to the left section, a white dashed rectangular border encloses three identical vertically stacked graphical representations.
- Each representation comprises a white circle containing a small, stylized icon similar to those in the left section, with arrows pointing right.
- Three arrows labeled "e1", "e2", and "eN" in white text point rightwards from the icons to indicate outputs.
- A green rectangle similar to the left contains a slightly different mathematical formula in white text: 

   e = Σ (w_i e_i)

- Here, "weighted average" is written in lowercase white text at the bottom.

Overall, the two sections illustrate a comparison between the bagging and boosting techniques, focusing on the averaging method used in each.
