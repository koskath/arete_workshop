# Slide 21 of Lecture 5 contains information about the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) transforms correlated variables into an uncorrelated set that exposes relationships among the original data items, identifies and orders the dimensions along which data points exhibit the most variation, and enables data reduction, with methods such as the Power Method used to compute the decomposition.
