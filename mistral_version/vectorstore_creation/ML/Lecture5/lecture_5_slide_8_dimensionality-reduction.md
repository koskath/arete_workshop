# Slide 8 of Lecture 5 contains information about the Dimensionality Reduction.

Dimensionality reduction has applications in machine learning, data mining, bioinformatics, biometrics, and information retrieval, and can be visualized, for example, with a multidimensional cube on which slicing operations separate different dimensions.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 8 of lecture 5 contains:

The image contains a visualization of dimensionality reduction, featuring three main components:

1. **Left Component (3 Dimensions 500 Positions)**:
   - A large 3D cube filled with small colored cubes.
   - Colors include red, blue, yellow, and green.
   - The cubes are randomly distributed within the larger cube, creating a dense cluster.
   - The cube is labeled at the top left, “3 Dimensions 500 positions.”

2. **Top Right Component (1 Dimension 50 Positions)**:
   - A rectangular strip positioned horizontally.
   - The strip contains smaller squares aligned in a single row.
   - The squares are colored in red, blue, yellow, and green.
   - The strip is linked to the 3D cube by a thin black arrow extending from the top face of the cube to the strip.
   - Labeled above as “1 Dimensions 50 positions.”

3. **Bottom Right Component (2 Dimensions 100 Positions)**:
   - A 2D square filled with small colored squares.
   - Colors include red, blue, yellow, and green.
   - The squares are loosely spread, simulating a projection of the original 3D arrangement onto a 2D plane.
   - The square is connected to the 3D cube by a black arrow originating from the side face of the cube.
   - Labeled above as “2 Dimensions 100 positions.”

- An arrow labeled “Dimensionality reduction” runs from below the 3D cube to the bottom right 2D square, emphasizing the transition from higher to lower dimensions.
