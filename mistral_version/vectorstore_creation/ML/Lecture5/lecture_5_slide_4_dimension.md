# Slide 4 of Lecture 5 contains information about the Dimension.

The dimension of an object can be defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it.

# The image in slide 4 of Lecture 5 is a visual illustration of how geometric objects extend as we move from lower to higher dimensions. 
It begins with a simple line segment representing one dimension, then shows how adding a second dimension produces a square, and adding a third dimension forms a cube. The pattern continues with four- and five-dimensional analogs—objects we cannot physically see but can represent through projections. Each step highlights that higher-dimensional shapes are built from duplicated copies of the previous shape connected in a new perpendicular direction. The purpose of the image is to help you build intuition about what “more dimensions” means mathematically, even when those dimensions cannot be directly visualized.
