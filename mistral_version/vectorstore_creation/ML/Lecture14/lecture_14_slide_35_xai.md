# Slide 35 of Lecture 14 contains information about the XAI.

Explainable AI offers operational trust, improved optimization, and support for regulatory or compliance obligations, but it must be designed with fairness, debiasing, and drift detection in mind so stakeholders are alerted when models diverge from intended results. Effective XAI also includes model risk management, lifecycle automation that clarifies dependencies across data and services, and deployment practices that avoid oversimplifying or misrepresenting complex systems.
