# Here is what the image 1 in slide 8 of lecture 14 contains:

The image consists of a diagram depicting a federated learning system with a central "Federated Server" that interacts with three distinct healthcare facilities.

1. **Federated Server (Leftmost Box):**
   - A large rectangular box labeled "Federated Server."
   - Inside is a circular geometric figure representing a neural network labeled "Global Model."
   - Three green arrows point from this box to the three healthcare facilities on the right.

2. **Community Hospital (Top Box):**
   - A rectangular panel labeled "Community Hospital."
   - Inside, from left to right:
     - An icon of a padlock labeled "Privacy Preserving."
     - A geometric network icon labeled "Local Model."
     - An icon of a rectangular server.
     - A stack of three images of lungs labeled "Private Data."
     - A building icon resembling a hospital with a green roof and an "H" symbol.
   - From "Private Data," a green arrow points to the hospital building.

3. **Research Medical Center (Middle Box):**
   - A rectangular panel labeled "Research Medical Center."
   - Inside, from left to right:
     - An icon of a padlock labeled "Privacy Preserving."
     - A geometric network icon labeled "Local Model."
     - An icon of a rectangular server.
     - A stack of three images of lungs labeled "Private Data."
     - A tall building icon resembling a hospital with a green roof and an "H" symbol.
   - From "Private Data," a green arrow points to the hospital building.

4. **Cancer Treatment Center (Bottom Box):**
   - A rectangular panel labeled "Cancer Treatment Center."
   - Inside, from left to right:
     - An icon of a padlock labeled "Privacy Preserving."
     - A geometric network icon labeled "Local Model."
     - An icon of a rectangular server.
     - A stack of three images of lungs labeled "Private Data."
     - A building icon resembling a hospital with a green roof and an "H" symbol.
   - From "Private Data," a green arrow points to the hospital building.

- Additional green directional arrows connect each healthcare facility back to the Federated Server, indicating bidirectional communication.
- The overall layout is structured in a left-to-right orientation with the Federated Server on the left and the healthcare facilities aligned vertically on the right.
