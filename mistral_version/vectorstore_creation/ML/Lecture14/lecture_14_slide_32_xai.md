# Slide 32 of Lecture 14 contains information about the XAI.

Unlike opaque AI systems, XAI applies specific techniques to trace and explain every decision in the ML pipeline, addressing the common problem that architects may not fully know how standard algorithms reach their conclusions, which makes validation, accountability, and auditability difficult. Effective XAI balances prediction accuracy with clearly scoped rules and features to maintain traceability and provides decision explanations that build human trust, enabling sensitive applications in areas such as healthcare and finance.
