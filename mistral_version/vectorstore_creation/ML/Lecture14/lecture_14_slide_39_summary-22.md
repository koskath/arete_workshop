# Slide 39 of Lecture 14 contains information about the Summary (2/2).

Reinforcement Learning teaches agents to maximize cumulative reward by interacting with dynamic environments, progressing through environment definition, reward shaping, agent creation, training, and deployment. Explainable AI complements this by making model decisions understandable and trustworthy so projects meet requirements, users retain confidence, audits remain feasible, and risks are mitigated, ultimately aiming for interpretable models without sacrificing predictive accuracy.
