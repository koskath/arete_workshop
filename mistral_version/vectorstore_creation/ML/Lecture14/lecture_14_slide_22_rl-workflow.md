# Slide 22 of Lecture 14 contains information about the RL Workflow.

The RL workflow begins by defining the environment—either a simulated model or a physical system—that interfaces with the agent, followed by designing a reward signal that quantifies progress toward goals and carefully shaping it through iterations to ensure useful learning.
