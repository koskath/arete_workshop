# Slide 26 of Lecture 14 contains information about the RL Example: Car Parking.

In the car-parking example, the goal is to train the vehicle’s control agent to park in the correct spot. The environment encompasses everything external to the agent—vehicle dynamics, surrounding cars, weather, and more—while the agent relies on sensor inputs from cameras, GPS, and lidar to choose steering, braking, and acceleration actions. Through repeated trial-and-error episodes it tunes its policy, using reward signals to score each attempt and guide learning.
