Transfer learning is most effective when the source and target tasks are similar, their data distributions align, and comparable architectures can serve both purposes. Fine-tuning continues training a model on a task-specific dataset to improve performance on that original task, whereas transfer learning adapts the model to a related but distinct problem.
