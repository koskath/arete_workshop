# Here is what the image 1 in slide 30 of lecture 14 contains:

The image contains three main sections arranged horizontally from left to right:

1. **Left Section: AI System**
   - Enclosed in a square with a thin black border.
   - Contains a diagram of interconnected nodes.
     - Nodes are arranged in five vertical columns.
     - The leftmost column has four orange nodes, connected by orange arrows pointing rightward.
     - The second and fourth columns each have seven yellow nodes, connected by yellow lines.
     - The middle column has seven blue nodes, interconnected with blue lines.
     - The rightmost column has six black nodes, connected by black arrows pointing outward.
   - Below the diagram, there is the text "http://explainthatstuff.com".
   - Below the square are three bullet points in blue:
     - "We are entering a new age of AI applications"
     - "Machine learning is the core technology"
     - "Machine learning models are opaque, non-intuitive, and difficult for people to understand"

2. **Middle Section: Applications**
   - A large vertical rectangle with a grey background and a thick black border.
   - Titled "DoD and non-DoD Applications" at the top in bold black font.
   - Lists six applications in bold black font, centered:
     - Transportation
     - Security
     - Medicine
     - Finance
     - Legal
     - Military

3. **Right Section: User**
   - Circular image depicting a person using a laptop, with an expression of concern or confusion.
   - The background inside the circle is white, with a thin black border.
   - To the right of the image are six bullet points in brown, vertically aligned:
     - "Why did you do that?"
     - "Why not something else?"
     - "When do you succeed?"
     - "When do you fail?"
     - "When can I trust you?"
     - "How do I correct an error?"

Between the sections, there are two large, segmented rightward-pointing arrows:
- One grey arrow between the "AI System" and "Applications" sections.
- Another grey arrow between the "Applications" and "User" sections.
