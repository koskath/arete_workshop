# Here is what the image 1 in slide 9 of lecture 12 contains:

The image is a diagram of a neural network composed of multiple layers with annotations indicating the number of units in each layer. 

1. **Input Layer**:
   - Positioned at the bottom.
   - Rectangular and colored green.
   - Labeled "Input layer" with "784 units" on the left side.

2. **Hidden Layer 1**:
   - Positioned above the input layer.
   - Rectangular and colored light blue.
   - Labeled "Hidden 1" with "100 units" on the left side.

3. **Hidden Layer 2**:
   - Positioned above Hidden Layer 1.
   - Rectangular and colored red.
   - Labeled "Hidden 2" with "30 units" on the left side.

4. **Hidden Layer 3**:
   - Positioned above Hidden Layer 2.
   - Rectangular and colored light blue.
   - Labeled "Hidden 3" with "100 units" on the left side.

5. **Output Layer**:
   - Positioned at the top.
   - Rectangular and colored green.
   - Labeled "Output layer" with "784 units" on the left side.

6. **Annotations**:
   - An arrow labeled "Codings" points from Hidden Layer 2 to the right.
   - An arrow labeled "Reconstructions" points from the Output Layer to the right.

The layers are aligned vertically with lines connecting them, indicating the flow from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer.
