# Slide 6 of Lecture 6 contains information about the Gradient Boosting.

Gradient Boosting can be thought of as Gradient Descent plus Boosting: it works by sequentially adding predictors to an ensemble, each one correcting its predecessor by fitting to the residual errors, then summing all predictors’ outputs for the final prediction, with popular variants including Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).
