# Slide 17 of Lecture 6 contains information about the Support Vector Machine (SVM).

SVMs are used in applications such as handwriting analysis and face analysis for both pattern classification and regression tasks, and they offer strengths like relatively easy training, no local optima in the convex optimization problem, good scalability, and explicit control over the trade-off between classifier complexity and error, but their efficiency and performance depend heavily on choosing an appropriate kernel function.
