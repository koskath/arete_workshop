# Slide 10 of Lecture 6 contains information about the Support Vector Machine (SVM).

• SVM set of related supervised learning methods.
• Use: Classification and Regression
• Uses ML to maximize predictive accuracy while avoiding over-fitting.
• Can be defined as systems which use hypothesis space of a linear functions in
a high dimensional feature space.
• trained with a learning algorithm from optimization theory
• implements a learning bias derived from statistical learning theory*.
*provides a framework for studying problem of gaining knowledge, making predictions, making decisions from a set of data.
