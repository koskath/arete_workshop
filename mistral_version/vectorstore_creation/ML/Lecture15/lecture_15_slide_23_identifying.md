# Slide 23 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Identifying Ethical Considerations for healthcare.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 23 of lecture 15 contains:

The image is divided into four vertical sections containing structured information within flowchart-like diagrams. Each section has a title, processes, or statements in boxes and lines connecting them. 

1. **First Section (leftmost):**
   - Title: "Develop & Implement Process"
   - Vertical flow with boxes:
     - "Conception" (Oval)
     - Arrow pointing down to "Development" (Rectangle) with the subtext "Criterion Standard Existing Dataset"
     - Arrow pointing down to "Calibration" (Rectangle) with the subtext "Positive & Negative Predictive Values"
     - Arrow pointing down to "Initial Implementation" (Rectangle) with the subtext "Single Context Limited Population Restricted Use"
     - Arrow pointing down to "Subsequent Implementation" (Rectangle) with the subtext "New Contexts Larger Population Unintended Uses New Time Periods"

2. **Second Section:**
   - Title: "Evaluation & Oversight Process"
   - Connected diagonally by an arrow from "Development" in the first section to "Inspection" (Rectangle)
   - Vertical flow with box:
     - "Initial Implementation Evaluation" (Rectangle)
     - Arrow pointing down to "Subsequent Evaluations & Inspections" (Rectangle)

3. **Third Section:**
   - Title: "Questions About Characteristics or Decisions Raising Values-Based Issues"
   - Multiple horizontally placed connected boxes with lines linking them between this to other sections:
     - "Why this clinical topic or target outcome?"
     - "What is the overall goal?"
     - "What is the justification for the criterion standard?"
     - "Could the training datasets perpetuate bias?"
     - "How to tradeoff test characteristics (such as positive and negative predictive value)?"
     - "Who benefits and who does not based on how these tradeoffs are made?"
     - "Can application’s component processes, and how they work together to produce output, be inspected and understood?"
     - "Do test characteristics change in a real world application?"
     - "Does the potential benefit to potential harm evaluation change?"
     - "Do new harms as well as new potential benefits emerge?"
     - "Who benefits and who does not in this initial evaluation?"
     - "How are harms weighted in the evaluation?"
     - "Can the questions of the initial evaluation be rigorously re-answered? Can the application be inspected for ad hoc reasons?"
     - "Given changes in predictive associations over time often should this process be repeated?"

4. **Fourth Section (rightmost):**
   - Title: "Ethical Considerations"
   - Vertical list of boxes:
     - "Transparency"
     - "Auditability"
     - "Conflict of Interests"
     - "Social Justice"
     - "Benefit Seeking"
     - "Harm Minimization"
     - "Distributional Justice"
     - "Safeguarding Standards"
     - "Benefit & Harms Evaluation"
     - "Informed Consent"
     - "Ethical Equivalence of Similar Outcomes"
     - "Likelihood of Problems"
     - "Accountability"
