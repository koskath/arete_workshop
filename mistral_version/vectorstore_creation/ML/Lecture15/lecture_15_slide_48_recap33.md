# Slide 48 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Recap(3/3).

The final recap emphasizes how formal verification techniques such as SAT, linear programming, and SMT contribute to robust machine learning, complementing efforts to mitigate issues like class imbalance, concept drift, adversarial threats, and limited interpretability. Managing experiments requires careful tracking of who built the model, which hyperparameters and feature transformations were used, and which datasets supported training and evaluation. Model management then extends those records into production by defining models precisely, validating them over time, planning retraining cycles, ensuring backward compatibility, and addressing data management hurdles around integration, transformation, and metadata queries.*** End Patch
