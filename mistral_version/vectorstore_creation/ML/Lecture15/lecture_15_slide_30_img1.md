# Here is what the image 1 in slide 30 of lecture 15 contains:

The image is a diagram featuring two main sections, a left red-tinted section titled "Forward Alignment (Alignment Training)" and a right blue-tinted section titled "Backward Alignment (Alignment Refinement)." The sections are connected by processes and arrows to demonstrate relationships.

**Left Section - Forward Alignment:**
- Encased in a red dashed square labeled "Trained System" in the top-right corner.
- Includes a red process box titled "Learning under Distribution Shift (§3)" with an arrow pointing from "Distribution" to "Input."
- A linear flow from "Input" to "Learner" to "Output," shown with horizontal arrows.
- Underneath is a feedback loop, labeled "Feedback/Modeling," leading back from "Output" to "Learner," labeled "Learning from Feedback (§2)."
- An advisor box with three icons labeled "Advisors," depicting "Human & AI," "Human," and "AI."

**Right Section - Backward Alignment:**
- An upper smaller box titled "ASSURANCE (§4)" showing three horizontal components: "Safety Evaluations," "Interpretability," and "Human Values Verification."
- Below is a larger teal box titled "Governance (§5)," involving three components: "Third Parties," "Industry/Labs," and "Government."
  - "Third Parties" is described as "Academia, NGO/NPO" with an arrow labeled "Audits" pointing towards "Industry/Labs."
  - "Industry/Labs" includes a self-regulating loop with an arrow pointing back labeled "Self-Regulates."
  - "Government" is connected by arrows labeled "Regulates" towards "Industry/Labs" and "Complies" pointing back, with an additional arrow labeled "International Cooperation" pointing left.
  - A connecting arrow from "Government" labeled "Assists" pointing left towards the border of the box.

**Central Section:**
- Overarching label "Trained System" with an icon above the two main sections.
- Red arrow labeled "produces" from the "Trained System" to the Forward Alignment section and a blue arrow labeled "is subject to" pointing from the "Trained System" to the Backward Alignment section.
- An arrow labeled "present throughout lifecycle" from "Forward Alignment" bending right and connecting to the Assurance section.
  
**Bottom Section - Alignment Requirements:**
- A gray rectangle labeled "Alignment Requirements" spanning horizontally across both main sections.
- Arrows from "Forward Alignment" labeled "informs" and from "Backward Alignment" labeled "updates" pointing to the "Alignment Requirements" box.
- Underneath is an acronym "RICE" with labels: "Robustness," "Interpretability," "Controllability," "Ethicality."

All elements are linked through a combination of solid, dashed, and curved arrows.
