# Slide 19 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Overview of AI Stakeholders.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 19 of lecture 15 contains:

The image is a Venn diagram consisting of three intersecting circles, each labeled with a different category at the bottom: "Policy," "Organisations," and "Individuals." 

1. **Policy Circle:**
   - Positioned at the top of the diagram.
   - Contains the following elements:
     - "International bodies" (dark blue rectangle)
     - "European Union" (dark blue rectangle)
     - "Regulators" (dark blue rectangle)
     - "Research funding bodies" (dark blue rectangle)
     - "National policymakers" (dark blue rectangle)
     - "Ethics bodies" (dark blue rectangle, partially overlapping into the "Organisations" circle)

2. **Organisations Circle:**
   - Positioned at the bottom left of the diagram.
   - Contains:
     - "Developer/deployer companies" (red rectangle)
     - "Standardisation bodies" (red rectangle)
     - "Media organisations" (red rectangle)
     - "User companies" (red rectangle)
     - "Educational organisations" (red rectangle)
     - "Professional bodies" (red rectangle)

3. **Individuals Circle:**
   - Positioned at the bottom right of the diagram.
   - Contains:
     - "Activists" (light blue rectangle)
     - "Developers" (light blue rectangle)
     - "Lay experts" (light blue rectangle)
     - "Users" (light blue rectangle)
     - "Non-users" (light blue rectangle)

**Background:**
- The background has a gradient transitioning from light yellow at the top to dark blue at the bottom.

**Spatial Relationships:**
- The "Policy" circle overlaps both the "Organisations" and "Individuals" circles, creating a central intersecting area. 
- The "Ethics bodies" rectangle lies within this intersecting region.
- The "Organisations" and "Individuals" circles overlap slightly on the bottom edge but do not have labeled elements in their intersecting area.

The overall diagram visually represents the intersection and segmentation of different societal and organizational groups involved in these three categories.
