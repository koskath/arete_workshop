# Slide 34 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Evolution of NN Models.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 34 of lecture 15 contains:

The image is divided into three columns representing different generations of neural networks.

**First Column (First Generation):**
- Title: "First Generation" in bold within a light blue header.
- Subheading: "Thresholding as Activation."
- Bullet points:
  - "Single Layer Perceptron"
  - "Multi-Layer Perceptron"
- Diagram: A diagram of a neural network with two input nodes on the left, three middle nodes, and two output nodes on the right. Lines connect each input node to all middle nodes, and each middle node to all output nodes. Arrows are at the ends of input and output lines.

**Middle Column (Second Generation):**
- Title: "Second Generation" in bold within a light pink header.
- Subheading: "Deep Neural Networks"
- Bullet points:
  - "Convolutional Neural Networks"
  - "Recurrent Neural Networks"
  - "Generative adversarial Network"
  - "Capsule Networks"
- Diagram: A convolutional neural network architecture.
  - Arrows indicate direction from left to right.
  - Blocks labeled "Conv1" to "Conv5" contain nested rectangles:
    - "Conv1" has two dark gray rectangles labeled "C1.1" and "C1.2."
    - "Conv2" has two parts enclosed by curly braces, labeled "C2.1," "C2.2."
    - "Conv3" has three parts labeled "C3.1," "C3.2," "C3.3."
    - "Conv4" has two parts labeled "C4.1," "C4.2."
    - "Conv5" has three parts labeled "C5.1," "C5.2," "C5.3."
  - Rectangles have different shadings indicating "Convolution," "Max pooling," and "Fully Connected."

**Right Column (Third Generation):**
- Title: "Third Generation" in bold within a light green header.
- Subheading: "Spiking Neural Networks"
- Bullet points:
  - "Deep Spiking Neural Networks"
- Diagram: A block diagram with three main sections:
  - A top rectangular box divided into three sections labeled "Synaptic model," "Network architecture," "Learning rule."
  - Below, a central gray box labeled "Network" has arrows indicating rightward data flow.
    - To the left, a box labeled "Data Encoding" with "input" below it.
    - To the right, a box labeled "Data Decoding" with "output" below it.

Each section and diagram is clearly bordered and visually distinct from the others through shading and layout.
