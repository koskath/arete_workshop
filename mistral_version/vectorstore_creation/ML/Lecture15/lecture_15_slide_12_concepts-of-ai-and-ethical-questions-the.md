# Slide 12 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Concepts of AI and Ethical questions they raise.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 12 of lecture 15 contains:

The image is a diagram with a gradient blue background transitioning from light to dark from top to bottom. In the center, there is a dark blue oval labeled "Uses of the term AI." There are three other ovals connected to this central oval:

1. On the left is a dark green oval labeled "Machine learning (narrow AI)." It is connected to the central oval with a solid blue line.

2. On the right is a gray oval labeled "General AI." It is also connected to the central oval with a solid blue line.

3. Below is an orange oval labeled "Converging socio-technical systems." It is connected to the central oval with a solid blue line as well.

There are three rectangular boxes with annotations:

1. At the top left is a green rectangle labeled "Specific issues arising from machine learning."
2. At the top right is a blue-gray rectangle labeled "Metaphysical questions."
3. At the bottom is an orange rectangle labeled "General questions about living in a digital world."

Both the top rectangles are connected to their respective ovals with dotted blue lines. The bottom rectangle is not directly connected by lines.

Each component is distinctly outlined, and the text is centered within each shape.
