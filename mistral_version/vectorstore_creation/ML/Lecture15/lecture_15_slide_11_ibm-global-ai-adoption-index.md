# Slide 11 of Lecture 15 contains information about the IBM Global AI Adoption Index.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 11 of lecture 15 contains:

The image contains a diagram featuring a central blue circle with a white dot in the middle and concentric circular rings expanding outward, resembling a radar chart. The diagram is surrounded by six concise points of information, each linked to the central area by a thin line ending in a smaller circular node at the outer ring of the chart. 

1. **Top Center Node:**
   - **Percentage:** 44%
   - **Description:** Developing ethical AI policies

2. **Top Right Node:**
   - **Percentage:** 37%
   - **Description:** Tracking data provenance, changes in data and model versions

3. **Bottom Right Node:**
   - **Percentage:** 27%
   - **Description:** Reducing unintended bias

4. **Bottom Center Node:**
   - **Percentage:** 44%
   - **Description:** Safeguarding data privacy through the entire lifecycle

5. **Bottom Left Node:**
   - **Percentage:** 38%
   - **Description:** Guarding against adversarial threats and potential incursions to keep systems healthy

6. **Top Left Node:**
   - **Percentage:** 41%
   - **Description:** Making sure we can explain AI-powered decisions

7. **Left Middle Node:**
   - **Percentage:** 32%
   - **Description:** Tracking performance variations/model drift

The title is positioned at the top left of the image, reading, "Enterprises are taking steps to build trustworthy AI, but more progress is needed." The entire layout is set against a light gray background.

# Here is what the image 2 in slide 11 of lecture 15 contains:

The image is a diagram with the title "Top barriers hindering enterprises from successful AI adoption" at the top left. Below the title, five curved lines, evenly spaced and parallel, extend from the bottom left to the top right. Each line ends with a circular node containing percentages and text describing different barriers.

1. **First Node (Bottom-Left)**
   - A blue circular node.
   - Contains "33%" in large blue text.
   - Below the percentage, it says, "Limited AI skills and expertise" in smaller blue text.

2. **Second Node (Directly below the top node)**
   - A blue circular node.
   - Contains "25%" in blue text.
   - Below the percentage, it says, "Too much data complexity" in smaller blue text.

3. **Third Node (Center-Right)**
   - A blue circular node.
   - Contains "22%" in blue text.
   - Below the percentage, it says, "Projects too difficult to integrate and scale" in smaller blue text.

4. **Fourth Node (Top-Mid)**
   - A blue circular node.
   - Contains "23%" in blue text.
   - Below the percentage, it says, "Ethical concerns" in smaller blue text.

5. **Fifth Node (Top-Right)**
   - A blue circular node.
   - Contains "21%" in blue text.
   - Below the percentage, it says, "High price" in smaller blue text.

Each circular node has a subtle white glow and is connected by faint lines to their respective positions on the graph. The background is a light gray color.
