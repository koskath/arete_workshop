# Slide 6 of Lecture 3 contains information about the Fundamentals of Machine Learning.

Machine learning excels at two categories of problems where other AI techniques often fail: tasks programmers cannot easily describe, such as handwriting recognition or cognitive reasoning, and complex multidimensional problems that resist straightforward numerical reasoning, like weather forecasting or healthcare outcomes. Within ML, unsupervised learning seeks unknown structures or trends, while supervised learning operates when we already know the answers we want based on past or completed data.
