# Slide 28 of Lecture 3 contains information about the K-Means Algorithm.

The K-Means process initializes centroids randomly (top left), labels the instances (top right), updates the centroids (center left), relabels the instances (center right), and repeats this cycle until convergence, reaching an optimal clustering in just three iterations in this example.
