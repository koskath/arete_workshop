# Slide 10 of Lecture 3 contains information about the Unsupervised Learning.

Unsupervised learning searches for structure in data with unknown targets; the user provides data without labeled answers, and the machine uncovers useful hidden information through techniques such as cluster analysis (using K-Means or hierarchical clustering), density reduction to select relevant variables, and dimension reduction via principal component analysis.
