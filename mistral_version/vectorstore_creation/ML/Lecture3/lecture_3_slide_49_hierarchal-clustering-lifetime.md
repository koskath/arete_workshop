# Slide 49 of Lecture 3 contains information about the Hierarchal Clustering: Lifetime.

Lifetime refers to the distance between a cluster’s creation and the point at which it disappears by merging with another cluster; for example, clusters A, B, C, D, E, and F have lifetimes of 0.71, 0.71, 1.41, 0.50, 1.00, and 0.50 respectively, so the lifetime of (A, B) is (2.50 - 0.71 = 1.79).

# Here is what the graph in slide 49 of lecture 3 contains:

The image displays a bar chart with an x-axis labeled "object" and a y-axis labeled "lifetime." Both axes are marked with arrows indicating their positive directions. The x-axis has five categories labeled D, F, E, C, A, and B, in that order from left to right.

- The y-axis has tick marks at intervals of 0.5, ranging from 0.0 to 2.5, with numerical labels at 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5.

The bars for each category are outlined in green with the following details:

1. Bar under "D" reaches to 0.5 on the y-axis with the number "2" inside.
2. Bar under "F" reaches to 1.0 on the y-axis with the number "4" inside.
3. Bar under "E" reaches to 1.5 on the y-axis with the number "5" inside.
4. Bar under "C" reaches to 2.5 on the y-axis with the number "6" inside.
5. Bar under "A" reaches to 1.0 on the y-axis with the number "3" inside.
6. Bar under "B" also reaches to 0.5 on the y-axis, which fits the pattern seen in the data.

Overall, the chart has six distinct green bars, each corresponding to a category on the x-axis, and labeled with a number within each bar indicating the height on the y-axis.
