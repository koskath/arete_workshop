# Here is what the image 1 in slide 38 of lecture 3 contains:

The image contains three separate point cloud diagrams labeled as "database 1," "database 2," and "database 3," each depicting clusters of black dots resembling data points on a white background. 

- **Database 1**: This section displays one large, dense cluster of points forming a roughly circular shape, centrally located. Surrounding this central cluster, there are three smaller clusters, also circular but less dense compared to the main cluster.

- **Database 2**: The diagram here shows points forming one large spiral shape with a loose, open curve. Inside this spiral, a smaller cluster of points forms within the spiral's start, creating a circular shape. To the right of the spiral, there are two additional, smaller point clusters resembling a fragmented or irregular circular shape.

- **Database 3**: This part contains a main cluster of points forming a branching structure on the bottom right. At the top right, a medium-sized cluster of points appears as a relatively dense circular shape. Scattered throughout the rest of this section are multiple isolated dots of varying sizes, more sparsely distributed, with a smaller cluster of points near the top left of the diagram.

Each "database" section is distinctly labeled below its respective diagram as "database 1," "database 2," and "database 3."
