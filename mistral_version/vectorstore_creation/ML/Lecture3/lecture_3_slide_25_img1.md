# Here is what the image 1 in slide 25 of lecture 3 contains:

The image presents a scatter plot within a rectangular coordinate system. The x-axis is labeled "x1," and the y-axis is labeled "x2." The coordinate system displays five distinct clusters, or blobs, of data points, represented as small blue dots.

1. **Cluster Locations:**
   - The first cluster is located at approximately (-3, 3) on the plot, with points densely packed.
   - The second cluster is located at approximately (-3, 2.5), also densely packed.
   - The third cluster is located at around (-3, 1.5), resembling the density of the first two.
   - The fourth cluster is more dispersed, located around (-1, 2), with points scattered more loosely than the first three.
   - The fifth cluster is similarly dispersed, located roughly around (0.5, 2).

2. **Axes Details:**
   - The x-axis ranges from -4 to 2, with labeled ticks at -3, -2, -1, 0, and 1.
   - The y-axis ranges from 1 to 3.5, with labeled ticks at 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0. 

3. **Additional Elements:**
   - Below the plot, centered is the text: "An unlabeled dataset composed of five blobs of instances" in bold font.

4. **Plot Frame:**
   - The plot is bordered by a thin black line.

This visualization captures the spatial distribution of data points as distinct groups within the defined axis range.
