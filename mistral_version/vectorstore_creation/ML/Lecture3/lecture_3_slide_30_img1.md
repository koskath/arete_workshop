# Here is what the image 1 in slide 30 of lecture 3 contains:

The image consists of two side-by-side scatter plots. Each plot is a two-dimensional representation partitioned into colored Voronoi cells with data points and centroids:

**Left Plot (Solution 1):**

- Title: "Solution 1"
- Axes: 
  - The x-axis is labeled "x₁", ranging approximately from -3.5 to 1.5.
  - The y-axis is labeled "x₂", ranging approximately from 1.0 to 3.5.
- Voronoi Cells: 
  - Five polygonal regions, each with a different color (yellow, orange, pink, grey, light green).
  - Boundaries are marked with solid lines.
- Data Points: 
  - Black dots scattered around each centroid within respective regions.
- Centroids:
  - Five larger, white 'X' marks representing centroids.
  - Positioned roughly at (-3, 2.75), (-2, 2), (-1, 2.5), (-1, 1.5), and (0, 2).
  
**Right Plot (Solution 2 with a different random init):**

- Title: "Solution 2 (with a different random init)"
- Axes: 
  - The x-axis is labeled "x₁", ranging approximately from -3.5 to 1.5.
  - The y-axis is labeled "x₂", ranging approximately from 1.0 to 3.5.
- Voronoi Cells:
   - Five polygonal regions, each with a different color (yellow, pink, grey, orange, light green).
   - Boundaries are drawn with solid lines.
- Data Points:
  - Black dots dispersed around each centroid within respective regions.
- Centroids:
  - Five larger, white 'X' marks at different positions from the left plot.
  - Roughly located at (-3, 2.75), (-2, 1.5), (-1, 2), (0, 1.5), and (0.5, 2).

Both plots demonstrate clustering solutions with differently colored cells, centroids, and distributed data points reflecting different initial conditions or parameters.
