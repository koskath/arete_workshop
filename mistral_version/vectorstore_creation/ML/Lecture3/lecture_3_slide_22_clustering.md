# Slide 22 of Lecture 3 contains information about the Clustering.

Clustering aims to group similar objects together and separate dissimilar objects, yet defining the “best” clustering is difficult because there is no single test error or universally superior method; we cluster to learn what the groups are, to capture a prototype example for each group, to assign new examples to groups, and to find objects related to a new instance \(x_i\).
