# Slide 25 of Lecture 3 contains information about the K-Means.

K-Means is a simple, efficient clustering algorithm that often converges in just a few iterations; it was proposed by Stuart Lloyd at Bell Labs in 1957 (published in 1982), and Edward W. Forgy independently published virtually the same approach in 1965, so it is sometimes called the Lloyd–Forgy algorithm, as illustrated by an unlabeled dataset composed of five blobs of instances and detailed in Stuart P. Lloyd’s “Least Squares Quantization in PCM,” IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 28, no. 2 (1982): 129–137.
