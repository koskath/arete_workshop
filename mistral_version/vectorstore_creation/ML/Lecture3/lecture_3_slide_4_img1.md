# Here is what the image 1 in slide 4 of lecture 3 contains:

The image is divided into two sections, each representing a different approach. 

**Left Section: "Traditional AI techniques"**
- Title: "Traditional AI techniques" is centered above this section.
- It contains three rectangular boxes aligned horizontally:
  - The first box on the left is labeled "Data" in white with a gray border.
  - Below it, aligned vertically, is another box labeled "Logic" in white with a gray border.
- Two orange arrows point from "Data" and "Logic" towards a set of three interconnected, orange gear symbols in the center.
- Another orange arrow points from the gear symbols to a rectangular box labeled "Output" in orange with a darker border.
- Below this section, the text reads: "Static, Rule Based, No generalization."

**Right Section: "Machine Learning"**
- Title: "Machine Learning" is centered above this section.
- It contains three rectangular boxes aligned horizontally:
  - The first box on the left is labeled "Data" in white with a gray border.
  - Below, another box is labeled "Output" in white with a gray border.
- Two orange arrows point from "Data" and "Output" towards a set of three interconnected, orange gear symbols in the center.
- Another orange arrow points from the gear symbols to a rectangular box labeled "Logic" in orange with a darker border.
- Below this section, the text reads: "Dynamic, Data driven, Generalization."

Both sections show a simplified representation of processing flow using gears and directional arrows to indicate the flow of data, output, and logic processing.
