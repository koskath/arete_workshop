# Here is what the image 1 in slide 19 of lecture 3 contains:

The image consists of two scatter plots aligned vertically, with an arrow pointing downward between them. 

**Top Scatter Plot:**

- Title/Labels: No titles or axis labels are present.
- Data Points: Composed of numerous blue dots scattered across the plot.
- X-Axis: Ranges from -12.5 to 2.5 with tick marks at -12.5, -10.0, -7.5, -5.0, -2.5, 0.0, and 2.5.
- Y-Axis: Ranges from -8 to 8 with tick marks at -8, -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
- Cluster Formation: Two visible clusters, one centered around (-7.5, -3) and another around (-3, 2).

**Arrow:**

- Positioned between the two plots pointing downward.
- Colored in dark blue.

**Bottom Scatter Plot:**

- Title/Labels: No titles or axis labels are present.
- Data Points: Composed of multiple colored dots forming distinct clusters.
  - Red dots forming a large cluster centered around (-5, 0).
  - Yellow dots forming a smaller cluster around (-8, -3).
  - Green dots forming a small cluster around (0, 0).
- X-Axis: Ranges from -12.5 to 2.5 with tick marks continuing as above.
- Y-Axis: Ranges from -8 to 8 with tick marks continuing as above.

Both plots are enclosed in rectangular frames with x and y axes. The layout suggests a transformation or clustering operation from the top plot to the bottom plot.
