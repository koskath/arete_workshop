# Here is what the image 1 in slide 17 of lecture 3 contains:

The image contains a flowchart with a series of labeled rectangular boxes, arrows, and annotations. 

At the very top, there is text centered in large bold black letters that reads, "Before you Start.."

Below this text, there is the first rectangular box, which is horizontally oriented and shaded in gray. In the center of this box, the word "Collection" is printed in red. Attached to the top right corner of this box, there is a white speech bubble outlined in black, containing the text "Events/Process Generates Data" in black letters.

Below the "Collection" box, there is a downward-pointing arrow. 

Under this arrow, a second gray rectangular box is placed horizontally with the words "Data Selection" centered inside in red. To the left of this box, a white speech bubble outlined in black is present containing the words "Statistical Knowledge" in black.

Another downward-pointing arrow is depicted below the "Data Selection" box. 

At the bottom, there is a third gray rectangular box, similar in size and shape to the others, containing the words "Model Selection" in red at the center. To the right of this box is another white speech bubble outlined in black, which says "ML-Domain Knowledge" in black letters.

The elements are aligned vertically with the boxes and arrows organized to represent a process flow from top to bottom. The speech bubbles provide additional context to each of the respective boxes they are adjacent to.
