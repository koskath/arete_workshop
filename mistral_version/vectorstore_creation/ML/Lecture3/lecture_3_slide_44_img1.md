# Here is what the image 1 in slide 44 of lecture 3 contains:

The image contains two side-by-side plots within a single figure, each displaying a scatter plot arranged in a distinct spiral pattern. 

**Left Plot:**
- Title: "eps=0.05, min_samples=5"
- Axes: The horizontal axis is labeled "x1" ranging from approximately -2 to 3. The vertical axis is labeled "x2" ranging from approximately -1 to 1.5.
- Data Points: The plot shows numerous small circular points forming two intertwined spiral shapes.
  - The colors of the points vary, with sections in shades of blue, green, and yellow notably running through the spiral.
  - Superimposed on and around these spirals, there are large red crosses indicating additional points or potential outliers distributed primarily surrounding and slightly within the spiral lines.

**Right Plot:**
- Title: "eps=0.20, min_samples=5"
- Axes: The horizontal axis is labeled "x1" ranging from approximately -2 to 3. The vertical axis is labeled "x2" ranging from approximately -1 to 1.5.
- Data Points: This plot also displays numerous small circular points forming two distinct spiral shapes.
  - There are two main areas—each spiral cluster is colored uniformly. One is yellow (outer cluster) and the other is dark purple (inner cluster).
  - The background surrounding these spirals is shaded: light blue outlines the inner spiral, while a brownish shade covers the area between the spirals and the farthest outer areas.

Both plots share axes labels but differ in how clusters and potential outliers are represented due to the varying "eps" parameter in clustering.
