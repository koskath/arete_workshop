# Slide 4 of Lecture 2 contains information about the Supervised Learning.

Models are trained using labeled data so they can predict the desired output, with the goal of discovering a mapping function that links the input variable x with the output variable y. One example involves training a model to recognize dog breeds from photos using the Stanford Dogs dataset, which includes 120 breeds. Applications span image classification, fraud detection, and spam filtering.
