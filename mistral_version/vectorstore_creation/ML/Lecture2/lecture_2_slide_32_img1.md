# Here is what the image 1 in slide 32 of lecture 2 contains:

The image consists of two parts, labeled "A" and "B," and they depict dataset splitting methodologies.

**Part A:**
- A horizontal bar divided into two segments.
- The left segment is larger, colored orange, and labeled "Training."
- The right segment is smaller, colored light blue, and labeled "Test."
- Beneath the bar, a bracket extends across the entire length of the bar, labeled "Single Dataset" below a vertical line connecting the bar and the label.

**Part B:**
- A horizontal bar divided into three segments.
- The left segment is the largest, colored orange, and labeled "Training."
- The middle segment is smaller, colored light blue, and labeled "Validation."
- The right segment is the smallest, colored green, and labeled "Test."
- Beneath the bar, a bracket extends across the entire length of the bar, labeled "Single Dataset" below a vertical line connecting the bar and the label.

Both parts illustrate the division of a single dataset into different subsets for training, testing, and validation purposes.
