# Slide 17 of Lecture 2 contains information about the Dummy variables and one-hot encoding.

A dummy variable is simply a binary variable that takes values 0 or 1, and one-hot encoding transforms each possible value from a categorical feature into a new binary column, which can be implemented with utilities like `pd.get_dummies()` or `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder()`.
