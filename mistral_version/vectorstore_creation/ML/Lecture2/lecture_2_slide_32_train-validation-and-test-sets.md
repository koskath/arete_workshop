# Slide 32 of Lecture 2 contains information about the Train, validation and test sets.

Datasets can be split into two subsets — a training set for fitting the model and a test set to confirm it works, often created with code like `X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(…)`— or into three subsets consisting of training, validation for hyperparameter tuning, and test for final confirmation.
