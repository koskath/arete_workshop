# Slide 5 of Lecture 2 contains information about the Classification and Regression.

Classification is the process of finding a function that divides a dataset into classes based on different parameters, often using algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree Classification, and Random Forest Classification. The algorithm ultimately seeks a mapping function that connects input x to a discrete output y, enabling applications like image labeling and email spam detection.
