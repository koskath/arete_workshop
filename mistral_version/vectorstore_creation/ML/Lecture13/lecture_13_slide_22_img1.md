# Here is what the image 1 in slide 22 of lecture 13 contains:

The image is divided into two sections: a diagram on the left and a photograph on the right.

**Left Section: Diagram**

1. **Top Left Corner**: There is a blue diagram of two concentric circles, indicating a point in space. 
    - The inner circle is smaller, and the outer circle is larger.
    - There are arrows extending from the center of these circles pointing in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

2. **Below the Circles**: A text states: "Each dimension of the code vector is sampled independently from a simple distribution, e.g. Gaussian or uniform."

3. **Middle Left**: There is a black arrow pointing right, directed towards a set of three vertical white rectangles.

4. **Middle**: Three vertical white rectangles are aligned horizontally.
    - There are black arrows between each of them, pointing from left to right, suggesting a flow from the first rectangle to the last.

5. **Below the Rectangles**: A text states: "This is fed to a (deterministic) generator network."

6. **Middle Right**: A black arrow pointing right extends from the last of the three vertical rectangles.

**Right Section: Photograph**

- Depicts a panda lying on grass.
  
  - The panda has a white face with distinctive black patches around its eyes, black ears, and a black body.
  - The panda is looking forward with a gentle expression.
  - The background includes green grass and a portion of a concrete edge.

The overall layout of the image presents a sequential flow from the left diagram illustrating a distribution and network process, leading to the photographic result on the right.
