# Slide 4 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

Convolutional neural networks emerged from research into the brain’s visual cortex and have been popular for image-recognition tasks since the 1980s. Traditional deep neural networks do not scale well to large images: a modest 100×100 pixel input already contains 10,000 values, so even a first layer with 1,000 neurons would require roughly 10 million connections. CNNs address this challenge with partially connected layers, weight sharing, and 2D feature maps that align neurons directly with their spatial inputs.
