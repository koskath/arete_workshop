# Slide 33 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

GANs pit neural networks against each other so both improve: the generator consumes samples from a random distribution, often Gaussian noise, and produces candidate data such as images, while the discriminator receives either real training samples or generator outputs and predicts whether each input is genuine.
