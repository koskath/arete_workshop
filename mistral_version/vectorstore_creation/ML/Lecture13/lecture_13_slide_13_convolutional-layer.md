# Slide 13 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Convolutional Layer.

Neurons in the first convolutional layer connect only to pixels within their receptive fields rather than to the entire image, and neurons in subsequent layers receive input from a small neighborhood of the previous layer’s activations. This local connectivity enables the network to capture low-level features in early layers and progressively combine them into higher-level patterns.
