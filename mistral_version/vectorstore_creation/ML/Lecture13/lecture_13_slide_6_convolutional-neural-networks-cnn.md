# Slide 6 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

Convolution, the operation at the heart of CNNs, slides one function over another and integrates their pointwise product, drawing on deep connections to Fourier and Laplace transforms; convolutional layers in practice implement cross-correlation kernels that approximate this behavior. A CNN stacks three fundamental layer types—convolutional, pooling, and fully connected—but the convolutional layer remains the primary feature extractor and can demand significant RAM during training.
