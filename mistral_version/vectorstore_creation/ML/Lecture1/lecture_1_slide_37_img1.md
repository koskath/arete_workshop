# Here is what the image 1 in slide 37 of lecture 1 contains:

The image features a layered, semicircular diagram with three concentric arcs. The largest arc is labeled "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE" in white uppercase letters on a light green background. Within this arc, to the left, the text "Early AI stirs excitement." is positioned.

Inside the larger arc is the medium-sized arc labeled "MACHINE LEARNING," also in white uppercase letters, on a darker green background. Within this arc, on the left side, the text "Machine Learning begins to flourish." is placed.

The smallest innermost arc is labeled "DEEP LEARNING," in white uppercase letters on an even darker green background. Inside this arc, the text reads "Deep Learning breakthroughs drive AI boom."

Below the arcs, a horizontal timeline is represented by a light blue line with vertical hashes marking intervals. The timeline has labels, starting with "1950's" at the far left, followed by "1960’s," "1970's," "1980's," "1990’s," "2000's," "2010’s," and "2010+” on the far right.

The design visually represents the progression and relationship between artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning over time.
