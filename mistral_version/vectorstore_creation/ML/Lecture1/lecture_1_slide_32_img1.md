The image depicts a diagram consisting of a stacked set of five oval shapes arranged vertically to the right, with five corresponding colored labels and text descriptions aligned to the left.

1. **Top Oval:**
   - Color: Blue
   - Label: "Capture"
   - Text Description: "data acquisition, data extraction"
   - Connector: A line connects this oval to the label and text, positioned horizontally towards the left.

2. **Second Oval:**
   - Color: Orange
   - Label: "Maintain"
   - Text Description: "data staging, data pre-processing"
   - Connector: A line connects this oval to the label and text, positioned horizontally towards the left.

3. **Third Oval:**
   - Color: Red
   - Label: "Process"
   - Text Description: "data modeling (e.g., clustering/classification)"
   - Connector: A line connects this oval to the label and text, positioned horizontally towards the left.

4. **Fourth Oval:**
   - Color: Teal
   - Label: "Analyze"
   - Text Description: "predictive analysis, qualitative analysis"
   - Connector: A line connects this oval to the label and text, positioned horizontally towards the left.

The ovals are slightly overlapping, giving a stacked, layered appearance. The colors of the labels match the colors of the corresponding ovals. The labels are bold, and the text descriptions are written in a smaller, regular font. The overall alignment presents a visually tiered process flow from top to bottom.
