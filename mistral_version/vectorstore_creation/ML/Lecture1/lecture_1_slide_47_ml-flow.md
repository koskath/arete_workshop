# Slide 47 of Lecture 1 contains information about the ML Flow.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 47 of lecture 1 contains:

The image depicts a flowchart comprising eight rectangular boxes, each representing a different stage of a process. The boxes are connected by arrows indicating the direction of the flow.

1. **Top Row:**
   - The first box is labeled "Data collection" and is filled with a light yellow color. An arrow points from this box to the next.
   - The second box is labeled "Data preprocessing," also in light yellow. An arrow points to the next box.
   - The third box is labeled "Exploratory data analysis," continuing the light yellow color scheme. Another arrow directs the flow to the right.
   - The fourth and final box in the top row is "Model building," colored in light blue. An arrow points downwards from this box, leading to the bottom row.

2. **Bottom Row:**
   - The first box is labeled "Splitting data" and is filled with a light blue color. An arrow indicates the transition to the next box.
   - The second box states "Training and validation," maintaining the light blue fill. Another arrow points right.
   - The third box reads "Testing the model," still in light blue. The arrow directs the flow to the final box.
   - The fourth and final box in this row is labeled "Deploying the model," and is colored in light green. An arrow loops from this box back to the "Model building" box in the top row, completing the cycle.

The diagram visually represents the sequential stages involved in a data science or machine learning project, showing the cyclical nature of the process.
