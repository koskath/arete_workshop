# Slide 25 of Lecture 1 contains information about the Rule: Final Exam & Compulsory Assignments.

For doing group work alone: Go to administration and never through the teacher/course coordinator. Applies to both final exam and compulsory assignments. A student should talk to the teacher/course coordinator before applying the Study Board for exemption to do group work alone. When applying for exemption the student is asked to document that the student has made an effort to find a group.
