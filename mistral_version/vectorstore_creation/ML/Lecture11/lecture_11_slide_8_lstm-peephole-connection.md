# Slide 8 of Lecture 11 contains information about the LSTM Peephole connection.

Slide 8 explains the LSTM peephole variant, where extra connections route the previous long-term state into the controllers of both the forget gate and the input gate, thereby giving those gates direct visibility into the cell state. This modification often improves performance, though not universally, and the discussion references material from “Building Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models on Google Cloud Platform” by E. Bisong.
