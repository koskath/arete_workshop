# Slide 13 of Lecture 11 contains information about the Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM).

This slide introduces the bidirectional LSTM as an RNN variant built to improve on its unidirectional counterpart, originally designed for tasks such as speech recognition. A BLSTM combines the outputs from parallel networks that process the sequence in both directions, enabling the prediction of the next time step using information from both past and future context. It is particularly useful when the learning problem presents coherent contextual information and when sequence prediction performance is paramount, which is why slide 13 highlights these usage scenarios.
