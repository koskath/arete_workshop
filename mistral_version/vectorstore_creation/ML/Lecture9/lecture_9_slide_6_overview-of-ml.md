# Slide 6 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Overview of ML.

Machine learning consists of several key components: Data, Model, Objective Function, and Optimization Algorithm. Data refers to input and output data, and a common way of describing an input dataset is with a design matrix. Key issues include underfitting, overfitting, training error and test error. The Model is used to generate output, and can be either parametric models like linear regression or non-parametric models. The Objective function is a real valued function that provides a measure of how wrong the model is in terms of its ability to estimate the relationship between inputs and outputs.
