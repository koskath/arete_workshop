# Slide 22 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Perceptron.

The Perceptron is one of the simplest ANN architectures. It was invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt and is based on a slightly different artificial neuron called a threshold logic unit (TLU), or linear threshold unit (LTU). Inputs and output are numbers, and each input connection is associated with a weight. The TLU computes a weighted sum of its inputs, then applies a step function to that sum and outputs the result.
