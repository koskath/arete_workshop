# Slide 21 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Example.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 21 of lecture 9 contains:

The image is split into two sections: a diagram on the left and a table on the right.

* Threshold logic unit for the conjuction x1∧x2
### Diagram (Left):
- There are three key components: two arrows on the left and one circle connected to an arrow on the right.
- The left side has two arrows pointing towards a circle in the center. The top arrow is labeled "3" and originates from a label "x₁," while the bottom arrow is labeled "2" and originates from a label "x₂."
- Both arrows point towards the center of a circle. Inside the circle is the number "4."
- A single arrow extends from the right side of the circle, pointing right, labeled with "y."

### Table (Right):
- The table consists of four columns and five rows, including headers.
- The headers from left to right are "x₁," "x₂," "3x₁ + 2x₂," and "y."
- Row 1: (headers) x₁, x₂, 3x₁ + 2x₂, y
- Row 2: All columns contain "0."
- Row 3: The values are "1," "0," "3," "0" in sequence.
- Row 4: The values are "0," "1," "2," "0" in sequence.
- Row 5: The values are "1," "1," "5," "1" in sequence.
- The table is enclosed by lines, with vertical lines separating the columns.

The diagram and table are side by side, with the diagram occupying the left half and the table occupying the right half of the image. The elements are well-organized, with a clear representation of inputs, weighted sums, and outputs in both the diagram and table.

# Here is what the image 2 in slide 21 of lecture 9 contains:

* Threshold logic unit for the implication x2 --> x1

On the left side of the image is a diagram consisting of a circle with two incoming arrows and one outgoing arrow. The circle contains the symbol "-1" at its center. To the left of the circle, two arrows are directed towards it, labeled with numbers and variables. The top arrow is labeled "2" and originates from a point labeled "x₁." The bottom arrow is labeled "−2" and starts from a point labeled "x₂." An outgoing arrow on the right side of the circle is labeled "y."

On the right side of the image is a table with four columns and five rows, including the header row. The column headers are "x₁," "x₂," "2x₁−2x₂," and "y." 

- The first data row shows values: 0 for "x₁," 0 for "x₂," 0 for "2x₁−2x₂," and 1 for "y."
- The second data row shows values: 1 for "x₁," 0 for "x₂," 2 for "2x₁−2x₂," and 1 for "y."
- The third data row shows values: 0 for "x₁," 1 for "x₂," −2 for "2x₁−2x₂," and 0 for "y."
- The fourth data row shows values: 1 for "x₁," 1 for "x₂," 0 for "2x₁−2x₂," and 1 for "y."

The table is enclosed in a rectangular grid with horizontal and vertical lines separating the headers and data into individual cells.
