# Here is what the image 1 in slide 32 of lecture 9 contains:

The image depicts a neural network diagram with three distinct layers. 

1. **Layers and Nodes:**
   - **Input Layer:** Positioned on the left, consisting of two nodes, colored in light green.
   - **Hidden Layer:** In the middle, consisting of four nodes, colored in light blue.
   - **Output Layer:** Positioned on the right, consisting of a single node, colored in yellow.

2. **Connections:**
   - Each node in the input layer is connected to every node in the hidden layer with thin black lines.
   - Each node in the hidden layer is connected to the node in the output layer with thin black lines.

3. **Text Labels:**
   - Above the neural network, there is an arrow labeled "Feed-forward," pointing from left to right, indicating the direction of the data flow from the input layer to the output layer.
   - Below the neural network, there is an arrow labeled "Back-propagation," pointing from right to left, indicating the direction of the error correction process.
   - To the left of the input layer, there is an arrow labeled "Network Inputs," pointing towards the input layer.
   - To the right of the output layer, there is an arrow labeled "Network Output," pointing away from the output layer.
   - Next to the input layer, the phrase "Input Layer" is written.
   - Next to the hidden layer, the phrase "Hidden Layer" is written.
   - Next to the output layer, the phrase "Output Layer" is written.

The layout is symmetrical with arrows and labels clearly indicating the flow and processes within the neural network.
