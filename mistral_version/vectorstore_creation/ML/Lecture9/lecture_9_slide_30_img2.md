# Here is what the image 1 in slide 30 of lecture 9 contains:

The image contains a diagram with a circular node in the center labeled "df" in red. The circle is outlined in red. From the right side of the circle, there is a red arrow pointing towards the circle, labeled "dL/dz" to the right of the arrow.

From the left side of the circle, there are two arrows extending outwards. The top arrow is labeled "dL/dx" to the left of it, with an equation above it: "dL/dx = dL/dz * dz/dx" in red. The bottom arrow is labeled "dL/dy" to the left of it, with an equation above it: "dL/dy = dL/dz * dz/dy" in red.

The arrows originate from points on the circle such that they form two vectors moving from the direction of the circle towards their respective equations. The text is all in a red font, matching the color of the arrows and the circle outline, and is oriented horizontally. The spacing between the elements is even, giving a balanced appearance to the diagram. The layout suggests a representation of how derivatives are propagated in a backpropagation algorithm related to the function df.
