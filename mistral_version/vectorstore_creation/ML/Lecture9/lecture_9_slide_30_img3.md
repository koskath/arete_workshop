# Here is what the image 2 in slide 30 of lecture 9 contains:

The image contains a diagram illustrating a neural network feedback process. 

- On the left side, there are two horizontal arrows labeled “Input” pointing to a light blue rectangular box labeled “Neural Network.”
- From the blue box, a horizontal arrow labeled “Output” extends rightward toward a large circle.
- Inside the circle is a summation symbol (∑).
- From the circle, a horizontal arrow labeled “Error” points to the right and upwards, looping back towards the top left corner, and then turns downward, leading to the light blue box, labeled with “Adjust Weights.”
- Below the circle, a vertical arrow labeled “Desired” points upwards to the circle. 
- There are negative (-) and positive (+) symbols on the circle, corresponding to the “Output” and “Desired” inputs, respectively.
- All lines, arrows, and text are rendered in gray, except the light blue box labeled "Neural Network."
