# Here is what the image 1 in slide 20 of lecture 9 contains:

The image contains two sections: a mathematical expression at the top and a diagram at the bottom.

**Mathematical Expression:**

- The expression is for `y`, defined using a piecewise function:
  - The left part of the expression is `y = {`, with a large curly bracket opening to bracket two conditions vertically.
  - On the right of the curly bracket:
    - The first line: `1, if ∑_(i=1)^n w_i x_i ≥ θ,`
      - The summation symbol `∑` has bounds `i=1` at the bottom and `n` at the top, followed by `w_i x_i`.
      - The expression `∑_(i=1)^n w_i x_i` is compared using the greater than or equal to symbol `≥` against `θ`.
    - The second line: `0, otherwise.`
- The two lines are aligned vertically and correspond with the elements bracketed by the large curly brace.

**Diagram:**

- The diagram is directly below the mathematical expression.
- Center of the diagram: a circle contains the symbol `θ`.
- Three arrows interact with this circle:
  - Several arrows (shown by ellipsis `...`) are represented entering from the left.
    - The top labeled entry: `x_1` with `w_1` written along the arrow pointing toward the left side of the circle.
    - The bottom labeled entry: `x_n` with `w_n` written along the arrow also pointing toward the left side of the circle.
- On the right side of the circle, an arrow points outwards toward `y`.

The image accurately represents a decision boundary function and an associated network diagram with input weights and a threshold leading to an output decision.
