# Here is what the image 1 in slide 37 (Bonus Slide) of lecture 9 contains:

The image shows a plot of the sigmoid function, represented as a blue curve. The graph has two axes: the horizontal axis labeled "t" ranging from -10 to 10 with markings at -10, -7.5, -5, -2.5, 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10; and the vertical axis ranging from 0 to 1 with markings at 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00. 

There is a black vertical line at t=0 and black horizontal lines at the y-values 0.00 and 1.00. The curve starts near the point (-10, 0.00), increases steeply around t=0, and levels off near the point (10, 1.00). Dotted horizontal black lines extend across the plot at y=0.50, y=0.00, and y=1.00. 

In the top-left area within the plot, there is a legend or annotation box with a faint grey background. Inside this box is a blue line matching the line style used in the plot. Adjacent to the blue line, the text reads "σ(t) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-t}}", representing the mathematical expression of the sigmoid function.
