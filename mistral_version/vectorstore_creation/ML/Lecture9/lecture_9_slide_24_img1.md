# Here is what the image 1 in slide 24 of lecture 9 contains:

The image depicts a neural network diagram with:

- **Three input neurons** in the input layer:
  - On the left, a yellow circle labeled "1" with an annotation "Bias neuron (always outputs 1)" connected with a dotted line.
  - In the center, a green circle labeled "x₁", annotated "Input neuron (passthrough)" with a dotted line.
  - On the right, a green circle labeled "x₂".
  
- **Two output neurons** in the output layer:
  - Both neurons are light blue circles with a sum and step function symbol (Σ and step function) inside.
  
- **Connections:**
  - Six arrows from the input neurons to the output neurons, each arrow starting from an input neuron and pointing towards an output neuron.
  - The left, middle, and right input neurons (labeled "1", "x₁", "x₂" respectively) all connect with arrows to both output neurons.
  
- **Annotations:**
  - "Inputs" label beneath the input layer.
  - "Outputs" label above the output layer.
  - "Input layer" label to the right of the input neurons, encased in a dashed oval encircling the input layer.
  - "Output layer" label to the right of the output neurons, encased in a dashed oval encircling the output layer.
  - "TLU" label with a dotted line pointing to one of the output neurons.
  
Overall, the structure illustrates a simple neural network with an input layer consisting of bias and input neurons, and an output layer containing threshold logic units (TLUs).
