# Slide 8 of Lecture 9 contains information about the From Biological to Artificial Neurons.

Artificial neurons were first introduced in 1943 by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts. The first ANN was created to show how biological neurons might work together in animal brains to perform complex computations using propositional logic. In this biological analogy, "Dendrites" take input signals, while the "Axon" sends an output signal.
