# Here is what the image 1 in slide 36 (Bonus Slide) of lecture 9 contains:

The image displays a simple graph with two main components: a horizontal black line and a blue curve.

1. **Horizontal Black Line**: 
   - Extends across the entire length of the image from left to right.
   - Appears as a continuous, straight, and thin line.
   - There is a small open circle situated directly below this line, approximately one-third from the left edge of the image.

2. **Blue Curve**:
   - Begins near the left side of the image, slightly above the black horizontal line.
   - Initially, the blue line is slightly undulating but predominantly horizontal, closely following the black line.
   - It sharply ascends near the middle of the image, forming a steep vertical curve.
   - After reaching its peak, it transitions into a straight, horizontal path extending to the right end of the image, above the black line.

There are no additional annotations, labels, or axes present in the image. The background is plain white.
