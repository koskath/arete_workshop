# Here is what the image 1 in slide 7 of lecture 9 contains:

The image depicts a flow diagram of a neural network with related processes. At the center-left is a blue rectangle labeled "Neural Network." Two arrows labeled "Input" enter the left side of this rectangle from the left. Exiting the right side of the rectangle is one arrow labeled "Output" pointing right toward a circle. The circle contains a summation symbol (Σ) and is connected to two arrows. One arrow, emerging from the "Output" arrow, runs horizontally through the circle and continues to the right, labeled "Error." Another arrow labeled "Desired" points vertically upward into the bottom of the circle, accompanied by a plus sign ("+"). The two arrows meet within the circle, where the "+" and "-" signs indicate an operation involving the "Output" and "Desired" inputs. From the circle, an arrow labeled "Error" extends horizontally to the right. Additionally, an arrow labeled "Adjust Weights" extends from the top of the "Error" arrow, curving above and pointing back to the top of the "Neural Network" rectangle, indicating feedback.
