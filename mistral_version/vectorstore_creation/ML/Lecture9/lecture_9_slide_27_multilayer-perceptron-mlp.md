# Slide 27 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Multilayer Perceptron: MLP.

An MLP is composed of one input layer, one or more layers of TLUs called hidden layers, and a layer of TLUs called the output layer. Layers close to the input layer are called lower layers, while layers close to the outputs are called upper layers. Every input or hidden layer includes a bias neuron and is fully connected to the next layer. This slide shows an MLP with 2-inputs, one hidden layer of 4-neurons, and 3-output neurons. When an ANN contains a deep stack of hidden layers it is called a deep neural network (DNN).
