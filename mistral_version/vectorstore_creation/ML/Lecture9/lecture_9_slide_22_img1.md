# Here is what the image 1 in slide 22 of lecture 9 contains:

The image is a schematic diagram illustrating a perceptron model with inputs, weights, and an output. 

Central to the diagram is a large circle divided horizontally into two equal parts. The top half contains a piecewise step function symbol, resembling a horizontal line with a vertical step. The bottom half contains a summation symbol (Σ).

Below this central circle, there are three smaller circles connected to it with straight lines pointing upwards towards the central circle. Each smaller circle contains a weight notation: from left to right, "w₁", "w₂", and "w₃".

Below each smaller circle, there are horizontal lines pointing towards them from text labels. These labels are “x₁”, “x₂”, and “x₃”, respectively, signifying inputs.

The line coming from the top of the central circle, pointing upwards, ends with an arrowhead indicating the output direction. Next to this line is an annotation: "Output: hₒ(x) = step(xᵀw)".

To the right of the entire figure, there are three separate text annotations stacked vertically:
1. "Step function: step(z)"
2. "Weighted sum: z = xᵀw"
3. A label indicating sections of the diagram: "Weights" is horizontally aligned with the smaller circles containing "w" and "Inputs" is horizontally aligned with the "x" labels at the base.

The entire schematic is organized symmetrically with inputs at the bottom, weights in the middle, and output at the top, demonstrating the flow of the perceptron function from inputs through weighted summation to output.
