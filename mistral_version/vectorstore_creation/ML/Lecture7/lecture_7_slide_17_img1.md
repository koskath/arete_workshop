# Here is what the image 1 in slide 17 of lecture 7 contains:

```markdown
The image contains a scatter plot diagram with a multi-colored Voronoi diagram overlay, divided into five colored regions by decision boundaries. Each region has a distinct color: the top-left region is purple, the top region is light blue, the top-right region is pink, the bottom-left region is light red, and the bottom-right region is light green. Each region contains a cluster of small, colored markers, with each cluster being of different marker shapes and colors:

1. **Top-left (purple) region:** Contains blue triangle markers piled together indicating a cluster.
2. **Top (light blue) region:** Contains blue dot markers in a close-knit formation indicating another cluster just below the top-left region.
3. **Top-right (pink) region:** Contains purple diamond markers in a dense cluster.
4. **Bottom-left (light red) region:** Contains red circles forming a cluster.
5. **Bottom-right (light green) region:** Contains green square markers compactly grouped.

The plot is bounded by horizontal and vertical axes labeled with:
- The horizontal axis: ranging from -15 to 20.
- The vertical axis: ranging from -15 to 25.

An annotation marked by a red circle with the capital letter 'X' is located at the top-left outside of the specified regions at approximately coordinates (-10, 25).

Below the scatter plot, there is text with bullet points that reads:
- "K-means:"
   - "Find points that are far away from any mean."
   - "Find clusters with a small number of points."
