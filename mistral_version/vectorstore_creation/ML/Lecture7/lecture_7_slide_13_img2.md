# Here is what the image 2 in slide 13 of lecture 7 contains:

The image contains a scatterplot and text annotations below it. 

**Scatterplot Details:**
- The plot has a vertical y-axis labeled with the numbers: 2000, 4000, 6000, 8000, and 10000, increasing from bottom to top.
- The horizontal x-axis is labeled with the numbers: 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100, increasing from left to right.
- The plot area is populated with red dots representing data points.
- These red dots form a pattern that generally rises from the lower left to the upper right, indicating an upward trend. 
- There is one noticeable outlier above the main distribution, located approximately at (33, 6000).

**Text Annotations:**
- Two bullet points are present under the scatterplot:
  - "Scatterplot detects complex patterns."
  - "Only 2 variables at a time."
