# Here is what the image 1 in slide 55 of lecture 7 contains:

The image is a table with five rows and four columns. The first row contains the column headers: "Class 0," "Class 1," and "total," which are aligned to the right. The left-most column does not have an explicit header.

The second row contains the text:
- Left-most column: "Original dataset" followed by a line break and indented text "(equivalent to SMOTE percentage = 0)" 
- "Class 0": "570"
- "Class 1": "178"
- "total": "748"

The third row contains the text:
- Left-most column: "SMOTE percentage = 100"
- "Class 0": "570"
- "Class 1": "356"
- "total": "926"

The fourth row contains the text:
- Left-most column: "SMOTE percentage = 200"
- "Class 0": "570"
- "Class 1": "534"
- "total": "1,104"

The fifth row contains the text:
- Left-most column: "SMOTE percentage = 300"
- "Class 0": "570"
- "Class 1": "712"
- "total": "1,282"

Each row after the header row contains percentage values below class counts. These percentages are aligned with their respective class count columns and right-aligned:
- Second row percentages: "76%" under "Class 0" and "24%" under "Class 1" 
- Third row percentages: "62%" under "Class 0" and "38%" under "Class 1"
- Fourth row percentages: "52%" under "Class 0" and "48%" under "Class 1" 
- Fifth row percentages: "44%" under "Class 0" and "56%" under "Class 1" 

All text is in black, and the table has a simple grid layout with horizontal lines separating the header from the data rows. There are no vertical grid lines.
