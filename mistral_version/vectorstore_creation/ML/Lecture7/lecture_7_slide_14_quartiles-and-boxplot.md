# Slide 14 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Quartiles and Boxplot.

The first quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half of a data set, with about 25% of values below Q1 and 75% above it, while the third quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half, with about 75% below Q3 and 25% above it; when a data set has outliers, variability is often summarized by the interquartile range (IQR), which equals Q3 minus Q1, and a boxplot displays the five-number summary of a data set, consisting of the minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum values.
