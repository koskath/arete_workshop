# Slide 48 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Undersampling and oversampling.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 48 of lecture 7 contains:

The image consists of two main sections, each contained within a dashed border rectangle. The left section is labeled "Oversampling Process" and the right section is labeled "Undersampling Process."

**Left Section: Oversampling Process**

- **Left Group: Original Dataset**
  - Title: "Class 'A'" in a white rectangular speech bubble with a black border at the top.
  - Below the title, a tall column consisting of uniform blue rectangles stacked vertically. The stack is longer than the one on its right.
  - Beneath the stack, a braced label reads "Original Dataset."
  - Adjacent on the right, another stack with the title "Class 'B'" in a similar white rectangular speech bubble. 
  - This stack consists of shorter, uniformly sized green rectangles. This stack is shorter compared to "Class 'A.'"
  - The green stack is also labeled with "Original Dataset" along with the blue stack under the same brace.

- **Right Group: Final Dataset**
  - Title: "Class 'A'" in a similar dialog box at the top.
  - Below, a tall stack of blue rectangles, identical in length and number to the original "Class 'A'".
  - Adjacent on the right, with the title "Class 'B'", is an expanded stack of green rectangles now matching the height of the "Class 'A'" stack.
  - Annotations: Several arrows pointing diagonally from the original "Class 'B'" stack to the expanded final stack, labeled "Oversampling Minority Class."

**Right Section: Undersampling Process**

- **Left Group: Original Dataset**
  - Title: "Class 'A'" in a white speech bubble.
  - Tall column of stacked blue rectangles, similar to the "Class 'A'" in the left section.
  - Beneath, a braced label reading "Original Dataset."
  - Adjacent to the right, another shorter stack with title "Class 'B'". 
  - This is composed of green rectangles, shorter in height relative to "Class 'A'."
  - Both stacks are again covered by the brace labeled "Original Dataset."

- **Right Group: Final Dataset**
  - Title: "Class 'A'" in a speech bubble above the stack.
  - Stack of blue rectangles significantly reduced in height compared to the original.
  - Adjacent on the right, "Class 'B'" with a stack of green rectangles matching the reduced height of "Class 'A'."
  - Annotations: Several arrows pointing from the original "Class 'A'" stack to its shorter version, labeled "Undersampling Majority Class." 

Across both sections, stacks are rectangular columns. Blue rectangles are used consistently for "Class 'A'" and green rectangles for "Class 'B'". This illustrates the processes of increasing minority class size and reducing majority class size to address class imbalance.
