# Here is what the image 2 in slide 14 of lecture 7 contains:

The image is a vertical box plot diagram with a rectangular frame marking the boundary, containing a vertical axis marked with divisions. The axis on the left ranges from 0 to 2.5, with major tick marks at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5. Minor tick marks are present at increments of 0.1 between each major tick.

There is a vertical rectangular box in the middle of the plot spanning from 0.5 to 1.25 on the axis. A horizontal median line is located within this box at the 0.75 mark. The top side of the box, marking the third quartile, aligns with 1.25 and the bottom aligns with 0.5, the first quartile.

Above the box, a vertical line ("whisker") extends upward to the maximum value at 2.2. Below the box, another whisker extends down to the minimum value at 0.1.

There are annotations on the plot in blue and red. Near the top whisker, a blue line extends horizontally to a label that reads "maximum." Near the top of the box, another blue line extends horizontally to the label "third quartile." Near the bottom of the box, another blue line extends to the label "first quartile." Beneath the bottom whisker, a blue line points to the label "minimum." In the middle of the box, a blue line extends to the label "median."

A red bracket labeled "IQR" is positioned to the right of the box between the lines marking the first quartile and the third quartile. The label "IQR" is in red, with the bracket running parallel to the vertical axis.
