# Slide 35 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Sample Recommendation System.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 35 of lecture 7 contains:

The image is titled "Sample Recommendation System" at the top and it illustrates the stages of a recommendation system using a flowchart with six processes linked by arrows.

1. **Process 1: Login**
   - Located at the top left corner.
   - Shows a 3D figure sitting on a red chair, looking at a laptop.
   - Arrows:
     - Green upward arrow labeled "A user provides personal information" pointing towards "Recommendation System."
     - Blue downward arrow labeled "Recommend movie to user" pointing from "Recommendation System" to this process.

2. **Recommendation System**
   - Centered near Process 1 and Process 6.
   - Represented by a vertical blue text "Recommendation System" alongside the arrows.

3. **Process 2: A measured similarity between users**
   - Located in the top right.
   - Three stacked cubes, appearing black, represent the MovieLens Dataset.
   - Arrows:
     - Green downward arrow labeled "Adjacency matrix of users" pointing towards Process 3.
     - Red leftwards arrow labeled "Movies Rating" pointing towards Process 5.

4. **Process 3: Clustering users**
   - Lower right section.
   - Depicts multiple 3D figures connected by lines, indicating clustering.
   - Arrows:
     - Green arrow from Process 2.
     - Blue arrow labeled "Users in group" pointing towards Process 4.
     - Red downward arrow labeled "Cluster of user" pointing towards Process 4.

5. **Process 4: Matching user to suitable cluster**
   - Situated at the bottom left.
   - Displays groups of blue 3D figures in clusters connected by lines.
   - Blue arrow labeled "User personalize information" leading to Process 6.

6. **Process 5: List of popular movies**
   - Centered.
   - Illustrated by a film reel icon.
   - No outgoing arrows other than the one from Process 2.

7. **Process 6: List of recommending movies**
   - Lower left corner.
   - Represented by stacked black discs, suggesting a database.
   - Blue arrow labeled "User personalize information" coming from Process 4.
   - Orange arrow pointing right towards Process 5 labeled "List of popular movies."

The arrows and text annotations guide the flow from user login to clustering and movie recommendation phases, integrating data processing steps throughout the system.
