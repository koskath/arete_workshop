# Slide 20 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Global Distance-Based Outlier Detection: KNN.

KNN outlier detection works by computing the average distance from each point to its k nearest neighbors, sorting all n average distances, and then selecting the points with the largest average distances as outliers, effectively filtering out points that are far from their nearest neighbors.
