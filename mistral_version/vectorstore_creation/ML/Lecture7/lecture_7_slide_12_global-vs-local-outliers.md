# Slide 8 to Slide 12 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Global vs. Local Outliers.

Whether a red point is an outlier depends on context: if it has the lowest z-score in isolation, it acts as a global outlier, but if blue points are added nearby, the same red point may become a local outlier—still within the normal data range but far from other points—and we must also consider whether outlier groups exist and how repeating patterns affect outlier detection.
