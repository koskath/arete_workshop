# Slide 46 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Categorization of class imbalance.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 46 of lecture 7 contains:

The image is a flowchart diagram structured with nodes and arrows. 

- **Top Node**: 
  - Text: "Class Imbalance Learning"
  - Shape: Rounded rectangle with a dashed border
  - Positioned at the top center

- **Second Level Nodes**:
  - Three nodes directly below the top node, connected by vertical arrows:
    - **Left Node**:
      - Text: "Data Level Strategy"
      - Shape: Rounded rectangle with a dashed border
      - Connected to two nodes below with downward arrows
    - **Middle Node**:
      - Text: "Algorithm Level Strategy"
      - Shape: Rounded rectangle with a dashed border
      - Position: Middle of the second level
      - Connected to one node below with a downward arrow
    - **Right Node**:
      - Text: "Hybrid Strategy"
      - Shape: Rounded rectangle with a dashed border
      - Positioned at the right of the second level

- **Third Level Nodes**:
  - Four nodes directly below the second level nodes:
    - **Leftmost Node**:
      - Text: "Undersampling"
      - Shape: Rounded rectangle with a dashed border
    - **Second Node**:
      - Text: "Oversampling"
      - Shape: Rounded rectangle with a dashed border
      - Positioned to the right of "Undersampling"
    - **Third Node**:
      - Text: "Hybrid Sampling"
      - Shape: Rounded rectangle with a dashed border
      - Positioned to the right of "Oversampling"
    - **Rightmost Node**:
      - Text: "Algorithm Level Strategy"
      - Shape: Rounded rectangle with a dashed border
      - Positioned to the right of "Hybrid Sampling"

- **Connections**:
  - The top node "Class Imbalance Learning" connects to three second-level nodes with individual downward arrows.
  - The second-level node "Data Level Strategy" further connects to "Undersampling" and "Oversampling" with a horizontal branching line leading to vertical arrows.
  - The second-level node "Hybrid Strategy" connects directly to "Hybrid Sampling" with a straight downward arrow.
  - The second-level node "Algorithm Level Strategy" connects directly to another similar "Algorithm Level Strategy" node on the third level with a straight downward arrow.

The entire diagram is in black and white, with text centered in their respective shapes.
