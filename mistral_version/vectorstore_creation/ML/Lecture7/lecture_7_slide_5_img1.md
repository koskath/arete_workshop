# Here is what the image 1 in slide 5 of lecture 7 contains:

The image is a scatter plot featuring a collection of red data points plotted on a two-dimensional graph. The horizontal axis (x-axis) is labeled with values ranging from 0 to 100, marked at intervals of 20 (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100). The vertical axis (y-axis) is labeled with values ranging from 0 to 10000, marked at intervals of 2000 (0, 2000, 4000, 6000, 8000, 10000).

The data points are plotted such that their x-values range from about 0 to 100. Most points appear to fall along a curved, upward-sloping trend, indicating a positive relationship between the x- and y-values. The distribution of these points suggests a roughly exponential growth pattern.

There is one notable outlier: a single point located approximately at (30, 6000), which is visibly separated from the main cluster of data points.

Overall, the points become more densely packed as they approach higher y-values along the curve, particularly beyond the x-value of 60. The points are dispersed more widely at lower y-values on the left side of the graph but become increasingly tightly grouped as the plot progresses to the right.
