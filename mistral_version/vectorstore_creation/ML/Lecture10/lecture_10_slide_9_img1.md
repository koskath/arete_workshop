# Here is what the image 1 in slide 9 of lecture 10 contains:

The image is a diagram depicting a sequence of three interconnected blocks labeled "Neuron Memory Cells," with inputs and outputs at different timesteps. 

1. **Top Block:**
   - A rectangle with a light orange fill labeled "Neuron Memory Cells."
   - An input arrow labeled \( x_0 \) enters from the left into the block.
   - An output arrow labeled \( y_0 \) exits from the right.
   - The top right is annotated with a dashed red line labeled \( t_0 \), situated horizontally and labeled "timesteps" in black text aligned to the top.

2. **Middle Block:**
   - A rectangle with a light pink fill labeled "Neuron Memory Cells."
   - Two arrows enter this block from the left: the upper arrow is labeled \( y_0 \), and the lower arrow is labeled \( x_1 \).
   - An output arrow labeled \( y_1 \) exits from the right side.
   - The area is marked with a dashed red line labeled \( t_1 \).

3. **Bottom Block:**
   - A rectangle with a darker pink fill labeled "Neuron Memory Cells."
   - Two input arrows: the upper arrow labeled \( y_1 \) and a lower arrow labeled \( x_2 \) enter the block from the left.
   - An output arrow labeled \( y_2 \) exits from the right.
   - The section is marked with a dashed red line labeled \( t_2 \).

The blocks are connected by lines, where output \( y_0 \) feeds into the next block as input, and similarly from \( y_1 \) to the subsequent block. Each block operates at sequentially labeled timesteps \( t_0 \), \( t_1 \), and \( t_2 \).
