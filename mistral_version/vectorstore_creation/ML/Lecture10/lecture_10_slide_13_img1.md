# Here is what the image 1 in slide 13 of lecture 10 contains:

The image is divided into two sections, each featuring a conceptual diagram and accompanying text:

**Left Section:**

- **Text:** At the top left, a bullet point followed by the text "Synced sequence input to output: need to label each video frame (Video Classification)."
  - "Video Classification" is in red.

- **Diagram Below Text:**
  - A horizontal sequence of three yellow rectangles labeled "Memory cells."
  - Input is shown on the bottom left with an arrow pointing to the first "Memory cells" block.
  - Each "Memory cells" rectangle is connected to the next with rightward arrows.
  - Below each "Memory cells" block is a green circle labeled "Input" connected with an arrow pointing to the block.
  - Above each block is a blue circle labeled "Output" with arrows pointing from the block to the circle.
  - Dots on the far left and right indicate continuation beyond what is shown.

**Right Section:**

- **Text:** At the top right, a bullet point followed by the text "Encoder-decoder/sequence-to-sequence architecture: A sequence of words in a language as input, and we want a sequence of words as output in another language (Machine translation and Speech recognition)."
  - "Machine translation and Speech recognition" is in red.

- **Diagram Below Text:**
  - Two horizontally arranged boxes, one labeled "Encoder" on the left and the other "Decoder" on the right.
  - Each box contains two yellow rectangles labeled "Memory cells."
  - The "Encoder" section has an input arrow from the left into the first "Memory cells" block.
  - The "Memory cells" blocks within each section are connected by rightward arrows.
  - An arrow connects the "Encoder" section to the "Decoder" section.
  - Below each "Memory cells" block in the "Encoder" section is a green circle labeled "Input" with upward arrows directed toward the blocks.
  - Above each "Memory cells" block in the "Decoder" section is a blue circle labeled "Output" with downward arrows directed toward the blocks.
  - The "Encoder" and "Decoder" sections are encompassed by respective light blue and light pink backgrounds.
