# Slide 31 of Lecture 10 contains information about the TensorFlow’s Architecture.

TensorFlow’s execution engine takes care of running operations efficiently, even when the workload spans multiple devices or machines, and a JavaScript implementation called TensorFlow.js allows the same models to run directly in the browser.

Execution typically proceeds by building a graph using variables and placeholders, deploying the graph for execution, and then training the model by defining the loss function and computing gradients.​
