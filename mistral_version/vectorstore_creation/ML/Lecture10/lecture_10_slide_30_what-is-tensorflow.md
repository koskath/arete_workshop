# Slide 30 of Lecture 10 contains information about the What is TensorFlow?.

TensorFlow’s API revolves around tensors that flow from operation to operation, hence the name TensorFlow, and each tensor behaves much like a NumPy ndarray while still being able to represent a single scalar value.

You can create a tensor from a NumPy array and convert a tensor back to NumPy, apply TensorFlow operations directly to NumPy arrays and NumPy operations to tensors, and this flexibility assists when implementing custom cost functions, metrics, or layers.
