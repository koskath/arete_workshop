# Here is what the image 1 in slide 49 of lecture 1 contains:

The image is a two-dimensional plot with axes labeled "Feature 1" (horizontal axis) and "Feature 2" (vertical axis). Both axes have arrows indicating positive direction. Data points are represented by three different shapes: triangles, squares, and a star with an "X" over it.

- **Triangles**:
  - Located primarily in the left portion of the plot.
  - Two green triangles are closer to the "New instance" X, above it and to the left.
  
- **Squares**:
  - Scattered more densely on the right side and towards the center of the plot.
  - Both the triangle and square shapes are outlined in black.

- **New Instance**:
  - Represented by a large "X" in black, located towards the left-central part of the plot.
  - Labeled with an arrow and text "New instance," pointing to it from the left.
  
- **Nearest Neighbors**: 
  - Two gray arrows extend from the "New instance" X to one green triangle above, and one yellow square to the left.
  
- **Text Annotations**:
  - "New instance" label is positioned left of the "X."
  - "Training instances" label is located to the right, amidst the cluster of squares, without an arrow pointing to any specific point.

Overall, the plot visually represents different types of data points, nearest neighbors to a new instance, and their spatial relationships in a feature space.
