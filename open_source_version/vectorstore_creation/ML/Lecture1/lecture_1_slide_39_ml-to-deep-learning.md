# Slide 39 of Lecture 1 contains information about the ML to Deep Learning.

ML was defined in 1950s as “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.” Deep learning (DL) is a subfield of ML which uses neural networks with many layers. Layered network can process extensive amounts of data and determine the “weight” of each link in the network. 39 Src: https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained
