# Slide 38 of Lecture 1 contains information about the Data Science and Machine Learning.

Components of data science: data, (pre-) processing, statistical model and machine learning. One of the key feature of machine learning is prediction. In machine learning, we train models and evaluate models. Deep neural network has many hidden layers. Ex- Image classification, Natural language processing. Multiple machine learning problems overlap with statistics. Image Src: Introduction to Deep Learning andTensorflowByCineca, 2018 Italy.
