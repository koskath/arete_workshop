# Here is what the image 1 in slide 39 of lecture 1 contains:

The image depicts a neural network diagram consisting of several labeled sections. On the left, there are two photographs bordered in blue, vertically aligned. The top photo shows an orange and white cat, labeled "Cat," and below it is a photo of a brown and black dog, labeled "Dog." 

To the right of the photos, there is a vertical list of three terms: 
1. (Label)
2. (Feature/Image)
3. (Input Layer)

Adjacent to these terms is a series of circles representing nodes or neurons:

- The section labeled "(Input Layer)" contains seven light purple circles aligned vertically in a column.

- Moving right, the section labeled "(Hidden Layer 1)" includes seven darker purple circles also aligned vertically. Each circle in the input layer is connected by lines to every circle in this hidden layer.

- Next, in the section labeled "(Hidden Layer 2)," there are another seven circles in dark pink. Each circle in "(Hidden Layer 1)" is connected by lines to each circle in this layer.

- The section "(Hidden Layer 3)" contains seven orange circles aligned vertically. Each circle in "(Hidden Layer 2)" is connected to every circle in this layer.

- Finally, an "(Output Layer)" is labeled with the formula "Tᵧ = Ŷ." This section contains two yellow circles aligned vertically. Each circle in "(Hidden Layer 3)" is connected to each circle in the output layer.

This entire network shows a structure of connections between input, hidden layers, and an output layer, forming a fully connected neural network diagram.
