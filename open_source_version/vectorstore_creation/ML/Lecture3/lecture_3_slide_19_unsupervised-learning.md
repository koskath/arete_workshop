# Slide 19 of Lecture 3 contains information about the Unsupervised learning.

Labels are not provided in unsupervised learning, so the algorithm figures out how to group the data without explicit instructions, for example by segmenting a webstore’s customers or detecting outliers in transactions, using algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering, or dimensionality reduction via principal components analysis (PCA).
