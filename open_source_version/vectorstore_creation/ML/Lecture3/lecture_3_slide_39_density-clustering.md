# Slide 39 of Lecture 3 contains information about the Density Clustering.

Density-based clustering locates regions of high density separated by low-density areas, using parameters such as the maximum neighborhood radius (Eps) and the minimum number of points (MinPts) in an Eps neighborhood of a point: N (p) : {q ∈ D s.t. dist(p, q) ≤ Eps}. The idea is that neighborhood density must exceed a threshold, and the neighborhood shape depends on the distance function.
