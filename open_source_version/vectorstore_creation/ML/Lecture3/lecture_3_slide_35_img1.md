# Here is what the image 1 in slide 35 of lecture 3 contains:

The image is a line graph titled "The Elbow Method." It features a plot on a rectangular grid with two axes. The x-axis is labeled "Number of Clusters (k)," with values ranging from 1 to 9 at integer intervals. The y-axis is labeled "Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)," with values ranging from 0 to 350, marked at intervals of 50.

The graph shows a blue line connecting seven data points, marked with cross symbols (×), plotted at k values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9). The WCSS values at these points are approximately 300, 150, 75, 50, 30, 30, and 20, respectively. The line starts high at k=1, sharply drops towards k=3, and then flattens as k increases.

A red dashed vertical line is prominently drawn at k=4, labeled as "Elbow Point," indicating the suggested number of clusters. This annotation appears both on the graph and in a legend situated in the upper right corner of the plot area. The legend contains a small rectangle with the red dashed line and the text "Elbow Point" in black font.

The grid consists of both horizontal and vertical gray lines for each axis tick mark. The background is white, and there are no additional visual elements or data points beyond those described.
