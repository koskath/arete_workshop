# Here is what the image 1 in slide 33 of lecture 3 contains:

The image consists of two adjacent plots, each illustrating a Voronoi diagram generated from clustering data points in a 2D space.

**Left Plot:**

- **Title and Axes:** The title above the plot reads "k=3". The x-axis is labeled "x1", ranging from -3 to 1. The y-axis is labeled "x2", ranging from 1.0 to 3.0.
- **Regions and Colors:** 
  - A green region occupies the upper left, separated by a diagonal line from the lower gray region and a vertical boundary with the pink region on the right.
  - A gray region is located at the bottom left, with a sloped linear boundary separating it from the green region.
  - A pink region covers the remainder on the right.
- **Data Points:** Numerous small black dots are scattered across the plot, concentrated into clusters.
- **Cluster Centers:** Three large white 'X' marks are also present:
  - One 'X' is located in each colored region.
  - The 'X' in the green region is centered around (-3, 2.5).
  - The 'X' in the gray region is near (-3, 1.5).
  - The 'X' in the pink region is around (0, 2).

**Right Plot:**

- **Title and Axes:** The title above the plot reads "k=8". The x-axis is labeled "x1", ranging from approximately -3.5 to 1.5. The y-axis is labeled "x2", ranging around 1.0 to 3.0.
- **Regions and Colors:** 
  - Various colored regions are present, including blue, green, yellow, purple, gray, and orange areas, with differing shapes and boundaries.
  - Each region is delineated by linear boundaries, forming polygonal shapes.
- **Data Points:** Numerous small black dots are scattered across the plot, concentrated into more refined clusters than the left plot.
- **Cluster Centers:** Eight large white 'X' marks are present, distributed across the colored regions. Each 'X' is centered within its corresponding region.

Both plots depict how the number of clusters, k, affects the division of the data points into distinct regions through Voronoi tessellation, with different region boundaries and cluster centers (white 'X') based on the value of k.
