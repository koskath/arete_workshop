# Slide 6 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Supervised Categories.

Supervised learning covers both discrete-valued Boolean categories and real-valued outputs, using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines, noting that some neural networks—like autoencoders and restricted Boltzmann machines—can also be used in unsupervised settings.
