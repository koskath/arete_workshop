# Slide 12 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Compute KNN: Defining k.

In the KNN algorithm, the value of k specifies how many neighbors are examined to classify a given query point, and choosing k is crucial but nontrivial because different values can cause overfitting or underfitting: smaller k values typically yield low bias but high variance, while larger k values increase bias and reduce variance.
