# Slide 34 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Logistic Regression Types.

Binary logistic regression models a dependent variable with two possible outcomes (such as 0 or 1) and is widely used for tasks like predicting whether an email is spam or not, while multinomial logistic regression handles three or more unordered categories (for example, predicting which genre of movie a viewer is likely to see), and ordinal logistic regression covers three or more ordered outcomes, such as a grading scale from 0 to 12.
