# Slide 19 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Remember!!.

When using KNN, remember to scale features so that large-scale variables do not dominate distance calculations and small-scale variables are not neglected, and be aware of the curse of dimensionality: in high-dimensional spaces (for example with more than five features), the volume grows exponentially with dimension, requiring many more points to adequately fill the space.
