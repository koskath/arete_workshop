# Here is what the image 1 in slide 5 of lecture 4 contains:

The image is a flow diagram illustrating a machine learning process. 

1. **Labeled Data Section (Left Side)**:
   - A blue rectangle labeled "Labeled Data" contains a variety of geometric shapes:
     - Three white hexagons
     - Two white squares
     - Two white triangles
   - An arrow labeled "Model Training" points from this rectangle towards the center section.

2. **Labels Section (Bottom Left Corner)**:
   - A green rectangle labeled "Labels" contains:
     - A white hexagon next to the word "Hexagon"
     - A white triangle next to the word "Triangle"
     - A white square next to the word "Square"
   - A line connects this rectangle to the blue rectangle "Labeled Data."

3. **Model Training Section (Center)**:
   - A yellow circle labeled "Model Training" contains two black gears.
   - Two arrows, both labeled "Model Training" and colored black, originate from "Labeled Data" and point into this circle.

4. **Test Data Section (Bottom Center)**:
   - A green rectangle labeled "Test Data" contains:
     - A white square on the left
     - A white triangle on the right
   - An arrow points from this rectangle to the "Prediction" section.

5. **Prediction Section (Right Side)**:
   - A central circle labeled "Prediction" with multiple black dots, arranged in a circular pattern around it.
   - An arrow from this circle leads to a blue rectangle on the right, labeled "Square," containing a white square.
   - A second arrow leads to a blue rectangle labeled "Triangle," containing a white triangle.

In summary, the image shows a sequence from labeled data to model training, then to predictions involving geometric shapes, with each process and label clearly annotated.
