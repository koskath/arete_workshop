# Slide 30 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Logistic Regression.

• Logistic regression is a data analysis technique that uses mathematics to find the relationships
between two data factors.
1.Then uses relationship to predict the value of one of those factors based on the other.
2.Prediction usually has a finite number of outcomes, like yes or no.
• Steps:
1. Identify the question: Any data analysis begins with a business question. For logistic
regression, you should frame the question to get particular outcomes:
• Do rainy days impact our monthly sales? (yes or no)
• What type of credit card activity is the customer performing? (authorized, fraudulent, or
potentially fraudulent)
2. Collect historical data
3. Train the regression analysis model
4. Make predictions for unknown values
• logistic regression is a classification algorithm. It cannot predict actual values for continuous data. It
can answer questions like "Will the price of rice increase by 50% in 10 years?"
