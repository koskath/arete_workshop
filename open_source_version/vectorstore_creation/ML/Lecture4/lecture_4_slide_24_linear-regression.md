# Slide 24 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Linear Regression.

In statistics, a simple linear regression is written as y = mx + b, where y is the value to predict, x is the input feature, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept; linear regression models are relatively simple, long-established, well understood, and can be trained very quickly.
