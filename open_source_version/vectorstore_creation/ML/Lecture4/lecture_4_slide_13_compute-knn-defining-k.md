# Slide 13 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Compute KNN: Defining k.

The choice of k depends heavily on the input data: datasets with substantial noise or many outliers often benefit from higher k values, k is usually chosen to be odd to reduce ties in classification, and cross-validation is a practical way to tune k for a given dataset.
