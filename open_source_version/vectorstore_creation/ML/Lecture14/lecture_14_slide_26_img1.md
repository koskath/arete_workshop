# Here is what the image 1 in slide 26 of lecture 14 contains:

The image is divided into two main sections, labeled "agent" on the left and "environment" on the right.

**Agent Section:**
- The agent area is enclosed in a blue, irregular, rounded rectangle.
- Inside this area, there are two main blocks:
  - **Top Block:** A rounded rectangle labeled "function" within another rectangle labeled "policy." 
  - **Bottom Block:** A rounded rectangle labeled "reinforcement learning algorithm."
- Arrows and connections:
  - An arrow labeled "actions" points right from the "function" rectangle to the right side towards the environment.
  - A thick, curved line connects the "function" rectangle to the "reinforcement learning algorithm" rectangle. This line has an upward pointing arrow intersecting it, labeled "update."
- On the left side of the "reinforcement learning algorithm" rectangle, there are three lines labeled:
  - "rewards," pointing from the environment to the algorithm rectangle.
  - "observations," pointing from the environment to the algorithm rectangle.
  - "actions," pointing outward from the algorithm to the function.

**Environment Section:**
- This section shows a simple illustration of a car interior, viewing from behind the driver's seat.
- The scene includes:
  - The silhouette of a person seated in the driver's seat, facing forward, with details of the head and upper torso visible.
  - A steering wheel and a dashboard with gauges and controls are depicted in the foreground.
  - The rearview mirror is centrally positioned at the top of the interior view.
  - Beyond the car's windshield, a simplistic representation of a road or open landscape is visible, with lines suggesting a road or path.

Both sections are depicted in a simple, stylized manner, using shades of blue and black for contrast and clarity. The annotations and lines in the agent section indicate a relationship and interaction flow between the "agent" and "environment."
