# Slide 10 of Lecture 14 contains information about the Transfer Learning (TL).

In transfer learning, a model that was pre-trained on one task is fine-tuned for a related objective using additional data, such as adapting a dog classifier to recognize cats with a much smaller dataset that emphasizes distinguishing features. This approach saves time and cost across NLP, computer vision, and other domains, and it underpins many generative AI deployments.
