# Slide 4 of Lecture 14 contains information about the Federated Learning (FL).

Google coined the term “federated learning” in 2016 to describe a way of training AI models without exposing users’ private data. Because computation happens at the data source, FL can stream raw sensor readings locally while contributing only model updates to a shared objective. This decentralized process lets multiple parties collaborate without sharing confidential records, which in finance could mean combining customer summaries to build better credit scoring or fraud detection models.
