# Slide 25 of Lecture 14 contains information about the RL Implementation.

Reinforcement learning can be implemented in policy-based form, where the agent directly optimizes a deterministic or stochastic policy to maximize cumulative reward, value-based form, which focuses on learning value functions to guide action choices, or model-based form, which builds a simulator of the environment within which the agent practices. Because data accrues through trial-and-error interactions rather than being supplied upfront, classic Atari games have served as a benchmark playground for RL algorithms.
