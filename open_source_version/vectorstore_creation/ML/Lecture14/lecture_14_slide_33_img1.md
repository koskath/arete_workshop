# Here is what the image 1 in slide 33 of lecture 14 contains:

The image consists of two sections, each depicting a flowchart enclosed within separate rectangular outlines. 

**Top Section (Labeled "Today"):**
1. Consists of four main rectangular blocks aligned horizontally.
   - The first rectangle contains the text "Training Data."
   - The second rectangle reads "Machine Learning Process" with a rightward arrow connecting it to the first block.
   - The third rectangle is labeled "Learned Function" and is connected to the second block by a rightward arrow.
   - A rightward arrow from the third rectangle leads to a circular element labeled "Task."
2. A line emerges from the "Task" circle and points to an image of a person. Accompanying text beside the person:
   - Bullet points stating:
     - "Why did you do that?"
     - "Why not something else?"
     - "When do you succeed?"
     - "When do you fail?"
     - "When can I trust you?"
     - "How do I correct an error?"
   - The word "User" is positioned below the person.
3. Between the "Learned Function" rectangle and the "Task" circle, there's a label reading "Decision or Recommendation."

**Bottom Section (Labeled "XAI"):**
1. Contains five main blocks, similarly aligned horizontally.
   - The first rectangle is labeled "Training Data."
   - The second rectangle reads "New Machine Learning Process," with a rightward arrow connecting it to the first block.
   - A rightward arrow leads to the third rectangle labeled "Explainable Model."
   - A rightward arrow connects the third to the fourth rectangle labeled "Explanation Interface."
   - A rightward arrow from the fourth rectangle points to a circular element labeled "Task."
2. A line extends from the "Task" circle to an image of a person sitting with notes. Accompanying text beside the person:
   - Bullet points stating:
     - "I understand why"
     - "I understand why not"
     - "I know when you succeed"
     - "I know when you fail"
     - "I know when to trust you"
     - "I know why you erred"
   - The word "User" is positioned below the person.

Both sections utilize text and simple vector illustrations to convey the processes and relationships between each stage in the flowchart, emphasizing the user's interaction with the system.
