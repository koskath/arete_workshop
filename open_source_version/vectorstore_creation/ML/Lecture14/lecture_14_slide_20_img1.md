# Here is what the image 1 in slide 20 of lecture 14 contains:

The image depicts a block diagram illustrating the interaction between an "Agent" and an "Environment." There are two rectangular boxes connected by curved arrows. 

1. The top box is labeled "Agent" and is positioned centrally at the top.
2. The bottom box is labeled "Environment" and is positioned centrally at the bottom.
3. A curved arrow connects the "Agent" box to the "Environment" box, moving from the right side of "Agent" to the left side of "Environment." This arrow is labeled "Action \(a_t\)" on the right side.
4. Another curved arrow connects the "Environment" box to the "Agent" box, moving from the right side of "Environment" to the left side of "Agent." This arrow is labeled "State, Reward \(s_t, r_t\)" on the left side.
5. The labels of the curved arrows indicate the flow between the agent and the environment, with "Action" pointing downward from the agent to the environment, and "State, Reward" pointing upward from the environment to the agent.

The diagram uses thin black lines and standard sans-serif font for labels. The layout is symmetrical with a clear, simple flow of information.
