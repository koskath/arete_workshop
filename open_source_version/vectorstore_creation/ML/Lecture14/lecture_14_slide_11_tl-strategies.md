# Slide 11 of Lecture 14 contains information about the TL Strategies.

Transductive transfer learning focuses on moving knowledge from a specific source domain to a closely related target domain, which is valuable when little or no labeled data exists for the target; a classic example is reusing a sentiment model trained on product reviews to analyze movie reviews. Inductive transfer learning keeps the domain constant but changes the task, leveraging a pre-trained model’s familiarity with the data to accelerate training—such as fine-tuning a large text model for sentiment analysis.
