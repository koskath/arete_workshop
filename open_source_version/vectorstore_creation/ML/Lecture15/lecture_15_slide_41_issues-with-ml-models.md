# Slide 41 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Issues with ML models.

Additional issues involve adversarial learning, where attackers automatically craft adversarial examples to fool a model, and interpretability, since a model may transform an input X into an output Y through opaque operations. Interpretability determines how easily analysts can manage, assess, and correct a model’s behavior, which is why practitioners such as cybersecurity analysts often favor rule-based or signature-based systems over neural approaches when clarity is essential.*** End Patch}$
