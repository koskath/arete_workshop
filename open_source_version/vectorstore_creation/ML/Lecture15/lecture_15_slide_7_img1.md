# Here is what the image 1 in slide 7 of lecture 15 contains:

Title at the top center: "businessline" with "business" in black and "line" in blue.

Top right corner: A red circle with "bl." inside and "FREE TRIAL" text next to it.

Navigation bar under the title: Categories listed as "Companies / Markets / Portfolio / Opinion / Elections 2024". These are in smaller black text with forward slashes as separators.

Breadcrumb trail below the navigation bar: "Home" > "Info-tech", with "Home" hyperlinked.

Main headline text: "ChatGPT bug. OpenAI admits data breach at ChatGPT, private data of premium users exposed". "ChatGPT bug." is in red followed by a period. The rest is in black.

Subheadline: "Updated - March 25, 2023 at 09:29 AM | Hyderabad, March 25"

Article summary: "According to OpenAI, chat history, names, email addresses, payment addresses, the last four digits of credit cards were exposed" written in black.

Byline with a circular photo of a person: "BY K V KURMANATH"; the photo is small, showing a person with a blurred background.

Below the byline, there is an icon of a speech bubble with the text "COMMENTS" next to it in light gray.

To the right of "COMMENTS", there is a bookmark icon with the text "READ LATER" in gray.

The central image: Displays the word "ChatGPT" in a perspective view, with "Chat" in large white letters and "GPT" smaller, both against a black background. The letters appear slightly blurred and angled from left to right, giving a three-dimensional effect.

The entire layout has a clean, minimal design with ample white space.
