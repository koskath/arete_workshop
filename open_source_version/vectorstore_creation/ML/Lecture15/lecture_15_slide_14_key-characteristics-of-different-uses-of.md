# Slide 14 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Key Characteristics of different uses of “AI”.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 14 of lecture 15 contains:

The image contains a diagram with three main colored ovals interconnected by dashed blue lines, each labeled with different concepts. 

1. **Left Green Oval**: This large green oval is labeled "Machine learning (narrow AI)". Connected to it are three smaller green rectangles, each with a different label:
   - Top: "Unpredictability"
   - Middle: "Opacity"
   - Bottom: "Big data requirement"

2. **Right Gray Oval**: A large gray oval is labeled "General AI". Connected to this oval are three smaller gray rectangles:
   - Top: "Human nature"
   - Middle: "Nature of knowledge"
   - Bottom: "Nature of intelligence"

3. **Bottom Orange Oval**: This large orange oval is labeled "Converging socio-technical systems". Connected to this oval are three smaller orange rectangles:
   - Left: "Autonomy"
   - Middle: "Manipulation"
   - Right: "Social impact"

The spatial arrangement of elements is symmetrical. The green and gray ovals are positioned at the top left and top right, respectively, with the orange oval centered below them. The color of each set of ovals and rectangles varies between green, gray, and orange, corresponding to their parent oval. The background has a gradient blue hue, lighter at the top and darker at the bottom.
