In the main content area, there are several subheadings in a smaller, grey font: "Litigation | Attorney Analysis | Data Privacy | Legal Industry."

The article's title is in large, bold black text: "The perils of dabbling": AI and the practice of law.

Below the title, there is additional text indicating the authors and date:

A blue bar labeled "Commentary" with smaller, grey text following it says: "Attorney Analysis from Westlaw Today, a part of Thomson Reuters."

Adjacent to the author's information, there are icons for adjusting text size, depicted as two overlapping capital "A" letters.

At the center, there is a large, colorful image. It depicts a close-up of a computer motherboard, with two metallic letters "A" and "I" placed prominently. The letters have a rough, industrial texture with pinkish reflections on their edges. The motherboard has various electronic components, illuminated in red and orange hues, possibly from LED lights. The background shows circuit paths and several cylindrical components, creating a detailed and complex pattern.

Beneath the image, in smaller type, the caption reads: "AI (Artificial Intelligence) letters are placed on computer motherboard in this illustration taken June 23, 2023.
