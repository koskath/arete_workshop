# Slide 36 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Formal Verification for robust ML.

Formal verification for robust machine learning spans several categories, including satisfiability (SAT) approaches, linear programming, satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving, theorem proving, and incomplete verification techniques. These methods, described by Shafique et al., provide complementary ways to reason about model behavior under strict correctness guarantees.
