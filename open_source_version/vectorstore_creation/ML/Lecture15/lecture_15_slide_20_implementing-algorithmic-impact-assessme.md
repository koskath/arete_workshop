# Slide 20 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Implementing Algorithmic Impact Assessment.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 20 of lecture 15 contains:

The image is a complex flow chart depicting relationships among various entities and processes involved in algorithmic impact assessment. It contains labeled boxes, arrows with descriptive text indicating the nature of relationships, and icons representing different entities. The central element is an oval labeled "Algorithmic impact assessment," colored in red.

Here are the details:

1. **Central Entity:**
   - "Algorithmic impact assessment" is in the center, represented by a red oval.

2. **Entities Around It:**
   - **Professional body**: A grey rectangular box at the top left with a briefcase icon.
   - **Guidelines**: A green rectangular box with a paper icon, positioned to the center-left, between "Professional body" and "Algorithmic impact assessment."
   - **Standards**: An orange rectangular box with a document icon, located to the left of "Guidelines."
   - **Standardisation body**: A red rectangular box with a network icon, positioned at the bottom left.
   - **Legislature**: A dark blue rectangular box with a courthouse icon, located directly to the left of the central "Algorithmic impact assessment."
   - **Individual developer**: A light blue rectangular box with a single user icon, situated just below "Legislature."
   - **Consumer organisation**: A purple rectangular box with a group of people icon, located to the top right of the central oval.
   - **End user**: A light blue rectangular box with a single person icon, positioned at the far right.
   - **AI product**: A yellow rectangular box with a gear and globe icon, situated below "End user."
   - **Business**: A pink rectangular box with a line graph icon, at the bottom, directly below the central oval.

3. **Arrows and Relationships:**
   - From "Professional body" to "Guidelines": Arrows labeled "creates."
   - From "Guidelines" to "Standards": Arrow labeled "based on."
   - From "Standards" to "Standardisation body": Arrow labeled "develops."
   - From "Standardisation body" to "Professional body": Arrow labeled "is member of."
   - From "Guidelines" to "Algorithmic impact assessment": Arrow labeled "implemented through."
   - From "Professional body" to "Algorithmic impact assessment": Two arrows labeled "provides expert input" and "provides input."
   - From "Consumer organisation" to "Algorithmic impact assessment": Arrow labeled "represents."
   - From "Algorithmic impact assessment" to "Legislature": Arrow labeled "consults with."
   - From "Legislature" to "Algorithmic impact assessment": Arrow labeled "requires."
   - From "Legislature" to "Individual developer": Arrow labeled "uses."
   - From "Individual developer" to "Business": Arrow labeled "works for."
   - From "Individual developer" to "Professional body": Arrow labeled "may be member of."
   - From "Business" to "Legislature": Arrow labeled "must comply with."
   - From "End user" to "Consumer organisation": Arrow labeled "puts pressure on."
   - From "End user" to "AI product": Arrow labeled "uses."
   - From "AI product" to "Business": Arrow labeled "supplies."
   - From "AI product" to "Algorithmic impact assessment": Arrow labeled "uses."

This structural diagram demonstrates the interactions and dependencies among various bodies in the context of algorithmic impact assessment, highlighting the roles and contributions of each entity within this framework.
