# Slide 38 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Linear programming.

Linear-programming-based verification defines the system through linear constraints and casts the property being verified as an objective function, which can be framed as either a minimization or maximization problem. For deep neural networks, LP methods commonly check robustness against adversarial attacks, although their applicability is limited by the requirement that models or abstractions adhere to linear constraints.
