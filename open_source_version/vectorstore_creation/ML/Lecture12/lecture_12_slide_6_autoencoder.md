# Slide 6 of Lecture 12 contains information about the Autoencoder.

An autoencoder mirrors the multilayer perceptron architecture, with the important constraint that the number of neurons in the output layer matches the number of input features. In the illustrated setup, a single hidden layer with two neurons acts as the encoder, while a three-neuron output layer serves as the decoder. The resulting outputs are referred to as reconstructions because the autoencoder is trained to reproduce its inputs as faithfully as possible.
