# Slide 37 of Lecture 2 contains information about the Confusion Matrix.

A confusion matrix evaluates the accuracy of a classification model by arranging actual classes as rows and predicted classes as columns, allowing you to tally true positives (instances correctly predicted as positive), true negatives (correctly predicted as negative), false positives (incorrectly predicted as positive), and false negatives (incorrectly predicted as negative).
