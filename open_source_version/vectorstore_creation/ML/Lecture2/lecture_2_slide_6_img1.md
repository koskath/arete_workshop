# Here is what the image 1 in slide 6 of lecture 2 contains:

The image depicts a scatter plot with a line of best fit. The plot is enclosed within a square border with tick marks on all four sides. The x-axis is labeled with numbers ranging from 20 to 100 in increments of 10: 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100. The y-axis is labeled with numbers ranging from 0 to 100 in increments of 20: 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100. 

Scattered within the plot area are numerous small red circular data points, distributed in an upward trend from lower left to upper right, roughly forming a diagonal pattern. The density of these points appears fairly uniform throughout the plot.

Through the data points, a solid black line extends diagonally from the vicinity of the coordinates (20, 20) to (100, 80), crossing the plot from the lower left to the upper right. This line represents a linear regression line or line of best fit, capturing the general upward trend of the data points. The background of the plot is white, providing contrast for the data points and line.
