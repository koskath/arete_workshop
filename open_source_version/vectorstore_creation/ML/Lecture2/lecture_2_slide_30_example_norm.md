# Here is what the image 1 in slide 30 of lecture 2 contains:
# Example of normalization

The image contains two main scatter plots side by side, each within its own square frame, accompanied by histogram plots along the top and bottom axes. The purpose is to display an example of normalization

1. **Left Plot: "Raw Features"**
   - The left scatter plot is labeled at the top as "Raw Features."
   - The x-axis is labeled as "Feature 1," and the y-axis is labeled as "Feature 2."
   - The plot consists of densely packed small black dots scattered horizontally across the middle of the plot.
   - Three larger colored dots are present: a blue dot slightly above and left of center, a red dot to the right of the blue dot and slightly below it, and a yellow dot to the right of the red dot and slightly above it.
   - To the left of the scatter plot, a vertical blue histogram plot is aligned with the y-axis, showing a concentrated distribution of bars mostly near the horizontal midpoint.
   - Below the scatter plot, a horizontal blue histogram plot is aligned with the x-axis, showing a distribution of bars with two visible peaks.

2. **Right Plot: "Normalized Features"**
   - The right scatter plot is labeled at the top as "Normalized Features."
   - The axes are similarly labeled with the x-axis as "Feature 1" and the y-axis as "Feature 2."
   - This plot contains small black dots spread more densely and in a symmetric pattern around the center of the plot, forming an elliptical distribution.
   - The same three colored dots (blue, red, yellow) are clustered near the center, with the blue dot above the red dot and the yellow dot to the right of the red dot.
   - To the right of the scatter plot, a vertical blue histogram is aligned with the y-axis, showing a distribution concentrated around the midpoint, forming a roughly Gaussian shape.
   - Below the scatter plot, a horizontal blue histogram is aligned with the x-axis, also concentrated around the center, forming a roughly Gaussian distribution with two small visible peaks.

Both plots are contained in a larger layout without additional visible annotations or elements.
