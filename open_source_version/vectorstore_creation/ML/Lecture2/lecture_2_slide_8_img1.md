# Here is what the image 1 in slide 8 of lecture 2 contains:

The image is a scatter plot with the x-axis labeled "Feature 1" and the y-axis labeled "Feature 2," both having arrows indicating direction. The plot contains numerous small, solid grey circles scattered across the plane, primarily concentrated in the center, representing "Training instances." There are two larger marked points symbolized by an "X." The first, on the left, is a red "X" labeled "Anomaly" in red text. The second, on the right, is a green "X" labeled "Normal" in green text. Dotted lines connect the label "New instances," at the top center of the plot, to both the red "Anomaly" and the green "Normal" markers. The plot overall depicts a distribution of points with two specific highlighted instances classified as "Anomaly" and "Normal" against the backdrop of "Training instances."
