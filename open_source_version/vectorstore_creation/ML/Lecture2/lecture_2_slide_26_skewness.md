# Slide 26 of Lecture 2 contains information about the Skewness.

Skewness measures the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable around its mean, as described on Wikipedia, and `dataframe.skew()` returns the unbiased skew over the requested axis of a DataFrame, normalized by N-1, where an output of 0 denotes a symmetrical distribution. More information appears at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness.
