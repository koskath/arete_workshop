# Here is what the image 3 in slide 11 of lecture 2 contains:

The image shows a snapshot of Python code output, likely from a Jupyter Notebook.

- At the top left, there's a line of code in blue with a gray background labeled "In [89]:". The command displayed is `df["species_short"].value_counts()`.
  
- Below this, there is an output section labeled "Out[89]:" in red.

- The output shows a list of category counts in plain black text. The categories and their counts are:
  - "Adelie" with a count of 146.
  - "Gentoo" with a count of 120.
  - "Chinstrap" with a count of 68.

- There is a line below these counts reading "Name: species_short, dtype: int64", indicating the name of the object is "species_short" and the data type is "int64".

- The overall layout is vertical, with command input on top and the corresponding output below.
