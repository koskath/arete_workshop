# Slide 23 of Lecture 2 contains information about the Visualization with Matplotlib.

Visualization with Matplotlib typically begins with `import matplotlib as mpl` and `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`, relying mainly on the `plt` interface, optionally setting the classic style via `plt.style.use('classic')`. The `plt.show()` command should be used only once per Python session, figures can be saved with `fig.savefig('my_figure.png')`, and magic commands like `%matplotlib notebook` or `%matplotlib inline` enable interactive or static plots respectively.
