# Here is what the image 1 in slide 7 of lecture 2 contains:

The image consists of two scatter plots arranged vertically with a blue arrow pointing downward from the top plot to the bottom plot.

**Top Scatter Plot:**

- The plot is enclosed in a rectangular coordinate plane with horizontal and vertical axes.
- The x-axis ranges approximately from -12.5 to 2.5, marked with ticks and labels at -12.5, -10.0, -7.5, -5.0, and -2.5.
- The y-axis ranges approximately from -8 to 8, marked with ticks and labels at -8, -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
- It contains numerous scattered blue points densely populating the central region, forming a loose, roughly elliptical cloud.
- The points are dispersed widely but appear to cluster more densely towards the center, with outliers sparser towards the edges.

**Bottom Scatter Plot:**

- The plot is enclosed in another rectangular coordinate plane with horizontal and vertical axes.
- The x-axis ranges from approximately -12.5 to 2.5, marked with ticks and labels at -12.5, -10.0, -7.5, -5.0, and -2.5.
- The y-axis ranges approximately from -8 to 8, marked with ticks and labels at -8, -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
- The points are divided into three distinct color groups: red, yellow, and green.
- A large cluster of red points occupies the central region, forming a similar elliptical shape as the top plot and densely packed.
- A yellow cluster resides towards the left side, slightly below the central line of the plot.
- A small green cluster is located on the right, offset slightly upwards compared to the central line.
- The arrow connecting the two plots suggests a transition or transformation from the top plot to the bottom plot configuration.
