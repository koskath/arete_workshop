# Here is what the image 1 in slide 38 (Bonus Slide) of lecture 9 contains:

The image depicts a graph with two axes that intersect at the origin, forming a standard Cartesian coordinate system. The horizontal axis is labeled "zic," while there is no label on the vertical axis. Two distinct curves are plotted on this graph:

1. **Green Curve:**
   - This curve starts low on the left side of the plot and gradually increases in an S-shaped manner, resembling a sigmoid function.
   - On the left side of the graph, above the green curve, is a mathematical expression: "1 / (1 + exp(-wc^T * xi))" written in green.
   - On the right, near the top of the curve, the expression "h(zic)" is positioned in blue.

2. **Blue Curve:**
   - This curve is a piecewise linear function. It is horizontal on the left, rises vertically at approximately the middle, and then continues horizontally at a higher level.
   - The blue curve is not labeled directly, but it occupies the same space as the green curve for part of its path.

Both curves converge near the origin of the graph and then diverge, with the green curve smoothing out while the blue curve maintains its piecewise linear trajectory. The entire graph is drawn on an otherwise white background.
