# Here is what the image 3 in slide 38 (Bonus Slide) of lecture 9 contains:

The image shows a graph with a black vertical line and a black horizontal line intersecting at the origin, forming a coordinate axis. The vertical line extends slightly above and below the horizontal line. The horizontal line extends to the left and right from the vertical line. 

There is a blue line graph starting from the negative side of the horizontal axis, moving left to right. This blue line is horizontal initially, meeting the vertical black line. Upon intersecting, it abruptly changes direction, moving upward vertically, then continues horizontally to the right. 

The label "h(z_ic)" is placed on the right side of the blue horizontal line, parallel to the original horizontal black line. Below the horizontal black line and to the right is the label "z_ic". 

The blue line appears continuous, with a sharper corner at the point of vertical change, showing a step function behavior. The black axis lines and blue lines are drawn with relatively thin strokes.
