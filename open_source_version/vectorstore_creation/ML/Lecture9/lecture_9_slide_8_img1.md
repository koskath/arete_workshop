# Here is what the image 1 in slide 8 of lecture 9 contains:

**Left Diagram: Biological Neuron Structure**

- **Overall Shape:** The diagram depicts a stylized biological neuron.
- **Components:**
  - **Dendrites:** Extending from the left side of the neuron, labeled "dendrites," with a branching structure. A blue arrow is pointing towards the cell body, annotated with "impulses carried toward cell body."
  - **Cell Body:** Central part containing a blue circle labeled "nucleus.”
  - **Axon:** Extends to the right from the cell body, labeled "axon."
  - **Branches of Axon:** Smaller branches appearing mid-axon.
  - **Axon Terminals:** Far right end of the axon with further branching.
  - **Directionality:** A blue rightward arrow labeled "impulses carried away from cell body" indicating the direction of signal transmission.

**Right Diagram: Mathematical Representation of a Neuron**

- **Overall Shape:** Diagram of a mathematical model of a neuron, with components labeled and connected by arrows.
- **Components:**
  - **Input Section:**
    - Green horizontal line labeled "axon from a neuron" with variable \( x_0 \) noted above.
    - Red circle labeled "synapse," connecting the line to "dendrite."
  - **Weighted Inputs:**
    - Horizontal lines labeled \( w_0 \), \( w_1x_1 \), and \( w_2x_2 \) with arrows pointing towards a circle labeled "cell body."
  - **Cell Body:** Larger circle containing \( \sum w_ix_i + b \).
  - **Activation Function:** Denoted by \( f \), leading to the output section.
  - **Output Section:**
    - A green arrow labeled "output axon" extending rightwards from the activation function \( f \left( \sum w_ix_i + b \right) \), depicting output signal transmission.
    - Blue label "activation function" adjacent to the output line.

**Spatial Arrangement:**
- **Left Diagram:** Neuron components are organized linearly from dendrites on the left to axon terminals on the right.
- **Right Diagram:** Mathematical model components are organized vertically, with key labels describing each aspect from input, through processing, to output.

Both diagrams are enclosed within boxes with a shared border, placed side by side for comparative illustration of biological and mathematical neuron functionalities.
