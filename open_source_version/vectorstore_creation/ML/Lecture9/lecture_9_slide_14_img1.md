# Here is what the image 1 in slide 14 of lecture 9 contains:

The image displays a Cartesian plot with the title "Activation functions" at the top center. The x-axis ranges from -4 to 4, marked with increments of 2, labeled as -4, -2, 0, 2, and 4. The y-axis ranges from -1 to 1, marked in increments of 0.5, labeled as -1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0. The background has a light grid with vertical and horizontal lines at each axis tick.

Four distinct lines are plotted, each representing a different activation function:

1. **Red Line (Step Function):** A solid red line starts horizontally at y=0 for x < 0. At x=0, it forms a sharp vertical line from y=0 to y=1. It continues horizontally at y=1 for x > 0.

2. **Green Line (Sigmoid Function):** A green dashed line starts at y=0 above x = -4. It smoothly rises, crossing the y-axis at about y=0.5 when x=0, and asymptotically approaches y=1 as x increases.

3. **Blue Line (Tanh Function):** A solid blue line begins at y=-1 for x = -4. It smoothly increases, crossing the origin at (0, 0), and continues to rise, asymptotically approaching y=1 as x increases.

4. **Magenta Line (ReLU Function):** A magenta dash-dotted line lies on the x-axis for negative x-values (y=0 for x < 0). At x=0, it sharply changes to a diagonal line with a positive slope, extending upward beyond y=1 as x increases.

A legend is positioned in the top right corner of the plot with four entries:

- A red short line labeled "Step."
- A green dashed line labeled "Sigmoid."
- A blue short line labeled "Tanh."
- A magenta dash-dotted line labeled "ReLU."

Each entry in the legend corresponds to the color and style of each activation function plotted on the graph.
