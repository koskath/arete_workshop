# Slide 23 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Perceptron.

A single TLU can be used for simple linear binary classification. The Perceptron is composed of a single layer of TLUs, where each TLU is connected to all inputs. The TLU computes a linear combination of inputs, and if the result exceeds a threshold, it outputs the positive class. A fully connected or dense layer means all neurons in a layer are connected to every neuron in the previous layer. An extra bias feature is generally added (x = 1), and it is typically represented using a special type of neuron called a bias neuron that always outputs 1.
