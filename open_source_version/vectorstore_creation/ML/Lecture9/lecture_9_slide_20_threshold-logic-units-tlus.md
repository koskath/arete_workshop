# Slide 20 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Threshold Logic Units (TLUs).

A TLU is a processing unit for numbers with n inputs x ,...,x and one output y. The unit has a threshold θ and each input x is associated with a weight w . The threshold logic unit computes the function, and TLUs mimic the thresholding behaviour of biological neurons in a very simple fashion.
