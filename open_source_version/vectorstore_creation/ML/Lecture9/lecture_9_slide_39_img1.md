# Here is what the image 1 in slide 39 of lecture 9 contains:

The image displays a graph titled "ReLU Activation Function" at the top in bold black font. The graph consists of an x-axis and a y-axis intersecting at the origin (0,0). 

- The x-axis is horizontal, labeled with "-10" on the left and "10" on the right, with a right-pointing arrow indicating positive direction.
- The y-axis is vertical, labeled with "10" at the top, with an upward-pointing arrow indicating positive direction.

A red line starts at the origin (0,0) and extends diagonally upwards to the right, representing the ReLU function for x ≥ 0. This line continues toward the top right corner of the graph.

To the right of the graph, the mathematical expression "f(x) = max(0, x)" is written in black italic font, representing the ReLU function definition. 

No other markings, grid lines, or data points are present in the graph.
