# Here is what the image 1 in slide 40 of lecture 9 contains:

The image depicts a graph and equation of the Leaky ReLU activation function.

- **Title:** Centered at the top, it reads "Leaky ReLU Activation Function" in bold black text.

- **Coordinate Axes:**
  - The x-axis is a horizontal black line extending from -10 to 10. The axis is marked at -10 and 10 with corresponding labels near each end.
  - The y-axis is a vertical black line extending from 0 to 10. It is marked at 10 with a corresponding label.
  - Both axes have arrowheads indicating the positive direction.

- **Graph Line:**
  - A line in orange and red shows the Leaky ReLU activation function:
    - From x = -10 to x = 0, an orange line with a gentle positive slope starts slightly below the x-axis and approaches the origin. This part represents f(x) = 0.01x.
    - From x = 0 to x = 10, a red line with a steeper positive slope extends upward, passing through the origin. This part represents f(x) = x.

- **Equation on the Right:**
  - The function is defined on the right of the graph using a brace and two conditions:
    - \( f(x) = \begin{cases} 0.01x & \text{for } x < 0 \\ x & \text{for } x \geq 0 \end{cases} \)
  - The text "0.01x for x < 0" and "x for x ≥ 0" are written in black alongside their respective conditions.

The graph and equation together illustrate the Leaky ReLU function, showcasing how the function behaves for negative and non-negative values of x.
