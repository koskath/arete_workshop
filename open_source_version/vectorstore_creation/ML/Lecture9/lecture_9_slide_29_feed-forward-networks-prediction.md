# Slide 29 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Feed-Forward Networks (Prediction).

In Feed-forward networks, there is no cyclic connection between network layers. Input flows forward towards the output via several hidden layers. In a Feedforward NN, the signal flows in one direction from inputs to outputs.
