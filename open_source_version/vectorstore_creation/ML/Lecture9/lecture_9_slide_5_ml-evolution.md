# Slide 5 of Lecture 9 contains information about the ML Evolution.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 5 of lecture 9 contains:

The image is a timeline chart illustrating key developments in neural network history. Along a horizontal axis marked with decades from 1940 to 2020, several vertical lines extend upward, each labeled with a significant term or event in neural network development. Left to right, the vertical lines and their labels are:

1. **1940** - "McCulloch/Pitts Neurons" with a line extending up.
2. **1950** - "Hebbs Organization of Behavior" with a line extending shorter than the one before.
3. **1960** - "Rosenblatts Perceptron" in bold, with a line extending up.
4. **1960** - "Multi-Layer Perceptrons" in bold, with a line extending up parallel to the previous line.
5. **1980** - "Backpropagation" in bold, with a line extending up.
6. **1980** - "Hopfield Networks" with a line higher than the "Backpropagation" line.
7. **1990** - "Convolutional Neural Networks" with a line extending up.
8. **2000** - "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)" with a shorter line compared to previous ones.
9. **2010** - "Deep Learning" with a line extending roughly parallel to the LSTM line.
10. **2010** - "Deep Learning with GPUs" with a line extending up shortly after the "Deep Learning" line.

The timeline is marked at the bottom with vertical divisions, separating each decade from 1940 to 2020. Each label's line connects to the corresponding point on the timeline where the development occurred.

# Here is what the image 2 in slide 5 of lecture 9 contains:

A layered, semi-circular diagram presents the evolution of AI with labeled sections and a timeline. The largest outer layer is labeled "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE" in white capital letters against a light green background. Inside this is a smaller, darker green semicircle labeled "MACHINE LEARNING" in white, and nested within is the smallest, darkest green semicircle, labeled "DEEP LEARNING."

The background has descriptive text for each layer. Within the outermost section, the text reads, "Early AI stirs excitement." In the MACHINE LEARNING section, the text reads, "Machine Learning begins to flourish." The DEEP LEARNING section contains the text, "Deep Learning breakthroughs drive AI boom."

Below the semicircles is a horizontal timeline in light green with a blue baseline and vertical ticks marking decades from the 1950s to the 2010s. The labels below the ticks, in order, are "1950's," "1960's," "1970's," "1980's," "1990's," "2000's," and "2010's." Each decade mark has a blue vertical line extending above the baseline.
