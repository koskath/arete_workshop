# Slide 21 of Lecture 6 contains information about the AUC - ROC Curve.

AUC is the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, where the ROC plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at different probability thresholds that separate the two classes in a binary classification problem, and it measures how well a model separates the classes by quantifying the probability that the model assigns a higher score to a randomly chosen positive example than to a randomly chosen negative one.
