# Slide 13 of Lecture 6 contains information about the Support Vector Machine (SVM).

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 13 of lecture 6 contains:

The image contains three side-by-side panels demonstrating concepts related to Support Vector Machines (SVM):

**Left Panel:**
- **Axes:** Labeled 'x' (horizontal) and 'y' (vertical), both originating from the bottom-left corner labeled '0'.
- **Data Points:** Seven blue circles distributed towards the left of the panel. Five red triangles distributed towards the right of the panel.
  
**Middle Panel:**
- **Axes:** Identical to the left panel.
- **Data Points:** Similar distribution as the left panel; seven blue circles on the left, five red triangles on the right.
- **Line:** A black, diagonal line separating the blue circles from the red triangles, labeled "Best hyperplane" toward its top end.

**Right Panel:**
- **Axes:** Identical to the other panels.
- **Data Points:** Maintains the same distribution and colors as the previous panels.
- **Lines:** 
  - A black line similar to the middle panel, labeled "Best hyperplane" at the top.
  - A gray line parallel and left to the black line, labeled "Not as good" near the bottom.
  - Arrows perpendicular to lines illustrating margins:
    - "Large margin" arrow pointing from a red triangle to the black line.
    - "Small margin" arrow pointing from a blue circle to the gray line.

**Text Descriptions:**
- **Under the left panel:** 
  - "Data: red and blue, data has two features: x and y."
  - "We want a classifier that, given a pair of (x, y) coordinates, outputs if it’s either red or blue."
  
- **Under the middle panel:** 
  - "SVM takes data points and outputs hyperplane (In 2D it’s simply a line (decision boundary)) that separates tags."

- **Under the right panel:** 
  - "SVM maximizes margins from both tags."
  - "Not all hyperplanes are created equal." 

All panels include data points, lines, and annotations to explain the concept of finding the optimal hyperplane in a binary classification context using SVMs.
