# Here is what the image 2 in slide 16 of lecture 8 contains:

The image contains a set of five concentric ovals, centered towards the right side. These ovals are black and vary in size, increasing in size from the center outward. The smallest oval is in the center, surrounded by progressively larger ovals. 

Inside the innermost oval, there is a small red hexagon positioned slightly off-center towards the right, with a red dot in its center. The hexagon is outlined in blue.

A blue zigzag line starts at the top-left, extending towards the bottom-left, then moves horizontally towards the right, passing through the ovals. The line varies in angle and direction, creating sharp peaks and valleys. The zigzag line intersects and crosses the ovals multiple times as it moves from left to right.

Near the start of the blue line on the far left, there is a small solid blue circle. The circle is positioned just outside the largest oval, appearing disconnected from the line, but vertically aligned with the beginning of the zigzag pattern. The spatial relationship of these elements suggests a path through a defined area, centered around the series of concentric ovals.
