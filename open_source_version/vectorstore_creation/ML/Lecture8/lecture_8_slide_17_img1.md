# Here is what the image 1 in slide 17 of lecture 8 contains:

The image contains a mathematical expression and text. The text reads: “'Confusion' is captured by a kind of variance of gradients:”. Following the colon, there is a mathematical formula:

- The formula starts with a fraction with numerator "1" and denominator "n".
- Next is a large summation sign "∑" with index "i=1" below it and "n" above it, indicating the sum from i equals 1 to n.
- Inside the summation, there are double vertical bars "||" surrounding an expression, indicating the norm. 
- Inside these bars, the expression is "∇f_i(ω^t) - ∇f(ω^t)".
- After the closing of the vertical bars, there is a superscript "2".
- Each part of the notation, elements such as functions f_i and f, gradients ∇, and the variable ω raised to the power t (ω^t) are distinctly aligned and sized to fit the mathematical notation style.

The formatting highlights the complex notation used for capturing variance of gradients related to "confusion".
