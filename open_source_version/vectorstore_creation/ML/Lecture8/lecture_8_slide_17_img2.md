# Here is what the image 2 in slide 17 of lecture 8 contains:

The image contains a graph composed of curves, annotations, and text. At the top, there are five black curved lines, each labeled at the peak: \( f_1(w) \), \( f_2(w) \), \( f_3(w) \), \( f_4(w) \), and \( f_5(w) \), arranged from left to right. These curves intersect at a point labeled \( w^* \), marked with a blue asterisk located at the center of the image. 

Below the intersecting curves, there is a horizontal axis represented by a black line. Centered directly below the asterisk, the point \( w^* \) is indicated again with the same label.

Beneath the horizontal axis, there are three separate annotations: 

1. To the left, there is blue text that reads: "Every \( \nabla f_i(w) \) here points towards \( w^* \)" with an upward blue line connecting it to the left section of the horizontal axis.
   
2. In the middle under the intersection point, there is green text that says: "\"Region of confusion\": some \( \nabla f_i(w) \) point towards \( w^* \) and some don’t". This text is enclosed within a green brace that spans the central portion of the axis directly below the intersection point.
   
3. To the right, there is another blue text segment that reads: "Every \( \nabla f_i(w) \) here points towards \( w^* \)" with another arrow pointing from the right section of the axis.

The annotations use colors to differentiate each section, with blue text emphasizing uniform direction towards \( w^* \) and green indicating a mixed direction or area of uncertainty.
