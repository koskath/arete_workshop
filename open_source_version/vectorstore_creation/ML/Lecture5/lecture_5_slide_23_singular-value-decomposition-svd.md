# Slide 23 of Lecture 5 contains information about the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

SVD decomposes any matrix A into three matrices with special properties—an orthogonal matrix U, a diagonal matrix S, and the transpose of an orthogonal matrix V^T —such that A = U S V^T; here U^T U = I and V^T V = I, the columns of U are orthonormal eigenvectors of A A^T, the columns of V are orthonormal eigenvectors of A^T A, and the diagonal entries of S are the square roots of these eigenvalues in descending order.
