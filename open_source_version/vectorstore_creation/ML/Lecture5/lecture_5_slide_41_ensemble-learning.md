# Slide 41 of Lecture 5 contains information about the Ensemble Learning.

In machine learning prediction, noise, variance, and bias are key concerns, and ensemble learning addresses them by combining multiple predictors into a single model that often performs better than any individual model alone, typically by aggregating several weak learners into a strong one; ensembles are broadly categorized into bagging and boosting methods, which differ in which predictors they combine and how they combine them.
