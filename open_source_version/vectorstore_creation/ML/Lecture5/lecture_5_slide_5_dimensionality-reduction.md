# Slide 5 of Lecture 5 contains information about the Dimensionality Reduction.

Dimensionality reduction is the process of deriving a smaller set of degrees of freedom that can reproduce most of the variability in a dataset, with the goal of reducing dimensions by removing redundant and dependent features, typically by transforming the features from a higher-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional one using either unsupervised or supervised approaches.
