# Here is what the image 1 in slide 25 of lecture 5 contains:

The image contains a visual representation of a transformation of matrices, likely depicting a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

On the left side, there is a matrix titled "Original Data." This matrix is 2x2 and contains the following values:
- Top-left: 5
- Top-right: 3
- Bottom-left: 4
- Bottom-right: 2

Next, there is a rightward-pointing arrow indicating a transformation.

To the right of the arrow, there are three matrices labeled \( U \), \( \Sigma \), and \( V^t \).

1. The matrix labeled \( U \) is 4x2 and contains the following values:
   - Top-left: 0.8
   - Top-right: 0.2
   - Second row, left: 0.5
   - Second row, right: 0.4
   - Third row, left: 0.7
   - Third row, right: 0.1
   - Bottom-left: 0.1
   - Bottom-right: 0.9

2. The matrix labeled \( \Sigma \) is 2x2 and contains the following values:
   - Top-left: 11
   - Top-right: 0
   - Bottom-left: 0
   - Bottom-right: 2.5

3. The matrix labeled \( V^t \) contains a 2x2 grid with ellipses (...) indicating unspecified or larger set of values:
   - Both top cells and both bottom cells contain ellipses (...) without explicit numerical values.

The matrices are aligned horizontally with clear labels indicating their identities. The \( \Sigma \) matrix is centered under its label, indicating it represents a diagonal matrix of singular values.
