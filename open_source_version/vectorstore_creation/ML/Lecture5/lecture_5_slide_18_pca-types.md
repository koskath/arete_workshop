# Slide 18 of Lecture 5 contains information about the PCA Types.

There are several PCA variants: Randomized PCA quickly approximates the first \(d\) principal components but still requires the whole training set to fit in memory, Incremental PCA (IPCA) processes the training set in mini-batches by feeding them to the algorithm one at a time, and Kernel PCA performs complex nonlinear projections for dimensionality reduction.
