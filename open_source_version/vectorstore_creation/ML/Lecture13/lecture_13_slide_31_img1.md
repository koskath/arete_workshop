# Here is what the image 1 in slide 31 of lecture 13 contains:

The image consists of three rows, each containing six images of handwritten digits. Each digit is centered within a black square background. 

- **First Row (Normal):**
  - First Image: The digit "7," white on black.
  - Second Image: The digit "2," white on black.
  - Third Image: The digit "1," white on black.
  - Fourth Image: The digit "0," white on black.
  - Fifth Image: The digit "4," white on black.
  - Sixth Image: The digit "1," white on black.
  - Seventh Image: The digit "4," white on black.

- **Second Row (Noisy):** Each image corresponds to the first row but contains additional noise, appearing as random white speckles around the digits.
  - First Image: The digit "7" with noise.
  - Second Image: The digit "2" with noise.
  - Third Image: The digit "1" with noise.
  - Fourth Image: The digit "0" with noise.
  - Fifth Image: The digit "4" with noise.
  - Sixth Image: The digit "1" with noise.
  - Seventh Image: The digit "4" with noise.
  
- **Third Row (Adversarial):** Each image corresponds to the first row but has been modified with patterns that alter the appearance of digits.
  - First Image: The digit "7" with horizontal wave-like patterns.
  - Second Image: The digit "2" with horizontal wave-like patterns.
  - Third Image: The digit "1" with horizontal wave-like patterns.
  - Fourth Image: The digit "0" with horizontal wave-like patterns.
  - Fifth Image: The digit "4" with horizontal wave-like patterns.
  - Sixth Image: The digit "1" with horizontal wave-like patterns.
  - Seventh Image: The digit "4" with horizontal wave-like patterns.

To the right of the images, there is text:
- A bullet point followed by the label "Normal (top)" aligned with the top row.
- A bullet point followed by the label "Noisy (middle)" aligned with the middle row.
- A bullet point followed by the label "Adversarial (bottom)" aligned with the bottom row.
