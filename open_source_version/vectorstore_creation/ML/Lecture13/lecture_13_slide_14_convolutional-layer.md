# Slide 14 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Convolutional Layer.

Each neuron’s weights correspond to a small image patch matching its receptive field, and the resulting feature map highlights the regions that most strongly activate that filter. Because every neuron within a feature map shares the same parameters, the model uses far fewer weights than a fully connected network, enabling pattern recognition wherever the feature appears—unlike a traditional DNN, which typically learns location-specific detectors.
