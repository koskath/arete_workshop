# Slide 11 of Lecture 13 contains information about the CNN Components.

Feature maps are the matrices produced by applying convolutional filters to the input, revealing patterns such as horizontal or vertical lines; using multiple filters yields multiple feature maps, which then serve as the inputs to deeper convolutional layers in a CNN. Pooling layers, typically max pooling, summarize these maps to reduce their spatial size while retaining salient information—for example, applying 32 filters to a 32×32 RGB image generates 32 distinct feature maps because each filter extracts a different aspect of the image.
