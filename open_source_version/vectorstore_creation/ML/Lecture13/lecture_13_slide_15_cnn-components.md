# Slide 15 of Lecture 13 contains information about the CNN Components.

A fully connected network (FCN) layer—essentially a multilayer perceptron with nonlinear activations such as softmax—usually forms the final stage of a CNN. In a typical CNN model, convolutional layers directly follow the image input to extract features, pooling layers aggregate those features, and the FCN translates the high-level representations into predictions.
