# Slide 8 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

An image can be described as a matrix of pixel intensity values between 0 and 255, and in the grayscale case there is just one channel, with 0 representing black, 255 representing white, and intermediate values encoding the various shades. A simple 10×10 grayscale image therefore maps directly onto a 10×10 matrix of intensities, reinforcing the 2-D representation.


# The image in slide 13 of lecture 8 illustrates how a picture can be represented numerically for use in machine learning.
On the left, a visual image is divided into a grid of pixels, showing that an image is essentially a 2-D array. On the right, the same idea is shown for a grayscale version of the image, where each pixel is mapped to an intensity value between 0 and 255. Higher numbers correspond to lighter regions and lower numbers to darker regions. Together, the diagrams demonstrate that images can be expressed as matrices of pixel values, allowing algorithms to process them mathematically.
