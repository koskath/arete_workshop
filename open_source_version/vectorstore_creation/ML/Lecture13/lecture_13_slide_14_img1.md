# Here is what the image 1 in slide 14 of lecture 13 contains:

The image contains a diagram with three main components arranged in a triangular layout. 

1. **Bottom Component:**
   - A rectangle labeled "Input" on the top left corner.
   - It displays a grayscale, partial image of a traditional architectural structure, likely featuring roof tiles and multiple vertical and horizontal elements resembling columns or beams.

2. **Top Left Component:**
   - A rectangle labeled "Feature map 1" on the top left corner.
   - It contains a blurred grayscale version of the architectural structure, with emphasis on vertical lines and details, suggesting vertical filtering effects. The vertical features appear elongated and are more pronounced.

3. **Top Right Component:**
   - A rectangle labeled "Feature map 2" on the top left corner.
   - It shows another blurred grayscale version of the same architectural image, focusing on horizontal features. The horizontal elements are more distinct and drawn out.

4. **Annotations and Filters:**
   - Two arrows connect the "Input" image to each "Feature map."
   - The arrow pointing to "Feature map 1" is labeled "Vertical filter" with an icon of two vertical black rectangles.
   - The arrow directing to "Feature map 2" is labeled "Horizontal filter" with an icon of two horizontal black rectangles.

The components are connected by diagonal arrows indicating the process of applying specific filters (vertical and horizontal) to derive the respective feature maps from the input image. The layout visually conveys the process of feature extraction in image processing.
