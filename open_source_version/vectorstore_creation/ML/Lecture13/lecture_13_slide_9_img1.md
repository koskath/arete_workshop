# Here is what the image 1 in slide 9 of lecture 13 contains:

The image illustrates a schematic representation of a convolutional neural network process, divided into several components from left to right:

1. **Image Section**:
   - On the far left, there is an emblem featuring a red eagle perched atop a black shield, flanked by two white horses. Beneath the shield, there is a banner with text reading "UNITY AND FAITH, PEACE AND PROGRESS".
   - Below this emblem, the label "Image" is written.

2. **Image in Pixels Section**:
   - To the right of the emblem, there are three overlapping sheets, outlined in red, green, and blue to represent RGB channels.
   - Below these sheets, the label "Image in pixels (R, G, B channels)" is displayed.

3. **Receptive Fields and Filters**:
   - To the right of the colored sheets, four thin, horizontal lines extend diagonally to the right.
   - The lines converge on four circular shapes arranged vertically within a vertical pink, elliptically shaped area.
   - Each circle is filled with a light orange color.
   - The vertical pink area is labeled "Filters (neurons in the convolutional layer)" at the top.
   - The horizontal lines are annotated with "Receptive fields".

4. **Feature Maps**:
   - To the far right, four vertically stacked, transparent sheets are outlined in light purple.
   - Small colored squares are scattered across these sheets, representing data points.
   - Below these sheets, the label "Feature maps" is present.

The image illustrates a process from an initial image through pixel representation, through convolutional filters, and finally to feature maps, indicating the transformation steps in a convolutional neural network.
