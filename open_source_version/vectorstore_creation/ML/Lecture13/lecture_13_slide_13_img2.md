# Here is what the image 2 in slide 13 of lecture 13 contains:

The image illustrates how convolutional neural networks process visual information through localized connections. In the first part, it shows that neurons in a convolutional layer do not connect to the entire input image but only to a small region called a receptive field. A kernel slides across the image, producing feature maps that highlight specific low-level patterns. The second part visualizes how neurons in deeper convolutional layers connect only to small regions of the previous layer’s feature maps. By stacking these layers, the network gradually builds increasingly complex representations: early layers detect simple patterns such as edges or textures, while later layers combine these into higher-level features.
