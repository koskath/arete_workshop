# Slide 22 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Generative Models.

Generative models learn to map random noise vectors to realistic outputs such as images, which requires a criterion to evaluate the generated quality, compute gradients with respect to the model parameters, and update those parameters so that subsequent samples look increasingly plausible.
