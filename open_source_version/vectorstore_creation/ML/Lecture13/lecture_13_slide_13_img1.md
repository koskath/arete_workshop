# Here is what the image 1 in slide 13 of lecture 13 contains:

The image depicts a three-layer diagram, illustrating a neural network processing structure.

1. Bottom Layer:
   - Labeled as "Input layer."
   - Shows an image of a house with a red roof, pink door, and gray walls.
   - The house sits on a light blue background with a thin green strip at the bottom, representing grass.
   - Dotted triangles with dashed lines emerge from the house, extending upwards.

2. Middle Layer:
   - Labeled as "Convolutional layer 1."
   - Consists of a transparent rectangular plane through which dotted triangles, originating from below, pass.
   - Has three small open circles (nodes) where the triangles intersect the layer.

3. Top Layer:
   - Labeled as "Convolutional layer 2."
   - Another transparent rectangular plane, similar to the middle one, positioned above.
   - A single open circle where one of the dotted triangles, extended further from the middle layer, intersects this top layer.

The dotted triangles represent paths of data processed through layers, showcasing a hierarchy in processing from the input image to higher convolutional layers in a neural network. The layers are parallel and horizontally aligned, with text labels positioned to the right of each layer stating their respective names.
