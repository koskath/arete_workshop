# Slide 9 of Lecture 13 contains information about the CNN Components.

The convolutional layer consists of filters, or kernels, that slide over the input pixels to capture patterns through the convolution operation, effectively applying a function to the input matrix to extract specific information. Each kernel produces a feature map that records where its target pattern appears, and the receptive field describes the portion of the input image that a particular neuron “sees” when computing its activation.
