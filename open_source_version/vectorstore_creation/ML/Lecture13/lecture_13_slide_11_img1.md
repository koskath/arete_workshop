# Here is what the image 1 in slide 11 of lecture 13 contains:

The image illustrates components of a convolutional neural network, visually divided into three main sections:

1. **Left Section:**
   - A three-dimensional box outlined in red, representing "Feature maps of previous convolutional layer."
   - The box appears to have multiple purple slices or layers inside it, running parallel to one another and evenly spaced.

2. **Middle Section:**
   - A vertical, horizontally elongated oval shape with a pink outline, labeled "Filters (neurons in the convolutional layer)."
   - Inside the oval are four large, evenly spaced yellow circles arranged vertically.
   - Black lines, labeled "Receptive fields," connect each yellow circle to various purple slices in the adjacent red-outlined left section.

3. **Right Section:**
   - Another three-dimensional structure consisting of several purple slices, labeled "Feature maps."
   - The number of slices appears to correspond to the feature maps generated by the neurons.
   - Each slice is outlined in purple and contains small square blocks scattered uniformly.

Overall, the visualization demonstrates the concept of filters being applied to feature maps from a previous layer, producing new feature maps in a layered network structure.
