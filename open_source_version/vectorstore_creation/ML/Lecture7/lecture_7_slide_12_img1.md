# Here is what the image 1 in slide 12 of lecture 7 contains:

The image contains a series of small scatter plots aligned horizontally. Above the plots, there is a bullet point statement in black text that reads, "Is the red point an outlier? What if we add the blue points?"

1. **First Scatter Plot (Leftmost)**:
   - Contains seven black "x" marks clustered together, forming a loose circular shape.
   
2. **Second Scatter Plot**:
   - Contains one red "x" mark situated centrally and isolated with no additional points around it.

3. **Third Scatter Plot**:
   - Similar to the second plot, but with the red "x" mark aligned vertically above another red "x" mark, creating a two-point column.

4. **Fourth Scatter Plot**:
   - Displays a single red "x" mark centrally placed with no other points surrounding it.

5. **Fifth Scatter Plot**:
   - Contains seven blue "x" marks clustered together, resembling the arrangement of the black "x" marks in the first scatter plot. Surrounding this blue cluster is a single red "x" mark located to the right side.

6. **Sixth Scatter Plot**:
   - Similar to the third plot, it has two red "x" marks aligned in a close vertical arrangement with one above the other.

7. **Seventh Scatter Plot**:
   - Contains a single red "x" mark, similar in positioning to the fourth plot.

8. **Eighth Scatter Plot (Rightmost)**:
   - Similar to the second plot, featuring a singular, isolated red "x" mark centrally placed within the plot.

There are no axes, scales, or additional annotations associated with any of the scatter plots. Each plot is evenly spaced horizontally from each other.
