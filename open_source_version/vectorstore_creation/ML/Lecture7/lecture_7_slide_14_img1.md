# Here is what the image 1 in slide 14 of lecture 7 contains:

The image is a diagram illustrating the calculation of the interquartile range. At the top, there are two horizontal lines. The line labeled "Lower half" extends above a series of numbers: 62, 63, 64, 64, 70. The second line on the right, labeled "Upper half," extends above another series of numbers: 72, 76, 77, 81, 81.

Between these horizontal lines, a vertical line extends from "70" to "72" with an arrow pointing downwards, labeled "Median = 71."

Below each half-line are labels: "Lower quarter" beneath the lower half numbers and "Upper quarter" beneath the upper half numbers. Arrows point upwards from two of the numbers: "Q₁ = 64" is identified below "64" in the lower quarter, and "Q₃ = 77" below "77" in the upper quarter.

Between the Q₁ and Q₃ labels, a clear rectangular box contains the text "Interquartile range: 77 − 64 = 13," annotated with arrows pointing upwards towards the Q₁ and Q₃ positions.
