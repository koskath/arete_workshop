# Slide 62 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Evaluation of classifiers using SMOTE/ADASYN.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 62 of lecture 7 contains:

The image is a flowchart consisting of multiple sections, boxes, arrows, and annotations. 

On the far left, there is an icon depicting a cylindrical storage labeled "Clinical Datasets" with a medical cross symbol in green. An arrow points right from this icon to a rectangular box labeled "Data Preprocessing" with a bulleted list underneath stating "Cleaning," "Transformation," and "Missing value imputation."

An arrow from the "Data Preprocessing" box points to the right, leading to a dashed rectangular area titled "Data Balancing Methods." Inside this area, there are six horizontally oriented oval shapes, each containing different terms: "Under Sampling," "Random Over Sampling," "SMOTE," "ADASYN," "SVM-SMOTE," "SMOTEEN," and "SMOTETOMEK." Each of these ovals has a blue arrow pointing right towards a central circular shape.

The central shape is comprised of two concentric circles. The inner circle is blue, and the outer circle is gray. This structure is labeled "Balanced Datasets."

From the "Balanced Datasets" circle, three arrow paths emerge. The leftmost path is labeled "Without Data Balancing" and arches upwards, combining into a dashed box on the right side labeled "Classification Techniques."

Within the "Classification Techniques" box, there are six horizontally oriented boxes: "Logistic Regression," "Decision Tree," "Support Vector Machine," "Gaussian Naïve Bayes," "k-Nearest Neighbour," and "Neural Network."

At the bottom center of the flowchart, beneath the circle labeled "Balanced Datasets," there is a list with the labels "Accuracy," "Precision," "Recall," and "F1-Score." Four arrows from this list point right towards the "Classification Techniques" section.

The overall structure of the image depicts a data processing pipeline starting from clinical datasets through preprocessing, various data balancing methods, and finally to classification techniques, with performance metrics evaluation.
