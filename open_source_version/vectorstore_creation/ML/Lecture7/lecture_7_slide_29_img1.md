# Here is what the image 1 in slide 29 of lecture 7 contains:

The image contains a diagram illustrating an "Amazon product recommendation method." At the top of the image, there is a text label in black, bold font: "Amazon product recommendation method:".

Below this text, the diagram features a mathematical expression consisting of the letter "X" on the left, which is written in black. Immediately to the right of the "X" is an equal sign.

Following the equal sign is a structure enclosed by square brackets. There are two thick, green vertical bars positioned inside these square brackets. The brackets and bars are stylized and appear somewhat hand-drawn.

The first green vertical bar is on the left within the brackets, and there is a small arrow pointing downwards toward it. This arrow is labeled "vs." in small, green handwritten text.

The second green vertical bar is positioned to the right, adjacent to the first. Below this bar, there is a hand-drawn arrow in black pointing upwards. The arrow is labeled "product" in handwritten black text just beneath it. 

To the right of the square brackets, there is another label that reads "user" in handwritten black text, positioned horizontally with an arrow pointing rightwards from the edge of the brackets to the label. 

The diagram illustrates relationships between users and products using these annotations within and outside the brackets.
