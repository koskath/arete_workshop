# Slide 13 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Graphical Outlier Detection.

The graphical approach to outlier detection involves plotting the data and visually identifying unusual points, with a human deciding whether each point is an outlier; boxplot(x) creates a box plot where a vector produces one box and a matrix produces one box per column, while scatterplots can detect complex patterns but only handle two variables at a time.
