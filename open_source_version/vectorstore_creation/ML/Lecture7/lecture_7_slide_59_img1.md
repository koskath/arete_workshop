# Here is what the image 1 in slide 59 of lecture 7 contains:

(a) ADASYN:

- Two side-by-side plots labeled with axes "X" and "Y." These axes are consistently labeled on the bottom for the "X" axis and the left for the "Y" axis.
- Left Plot: A set of spatially scattered blue circles intermingled with red plus symbols towards the center of the plot. Blue circles are more numerous than red pluses.
- Right Plot: Similar configuration as the left plot, with blue circles and a slightly higher concentration of newly generated red plus symbols, indicated by slightly transparent lines connecting them.
- An arrow between the two plots points from left to right, indicating progression or transformation.

(b) SMOTE:

- Again, two side-by-side plots with similar "X" and "Y" axis labels.
- Left Plot: Features a cluster of blue circles mixed with a group of red plus symbols in the center.
- Right Plot: Displays a similar mixture but with additional red pluses that are evenly distributed compared to the left plot, also highlighted by transparent connecting lines.
- An arrow points between the two plots from left to right, suggesting a similar progression or change as in the ADASYN depiction.

Overall Layout:

- The two methods, "ADASYN" and "SMOTE," are clearly separated into two panels labeled (a) and (b), respectively, with a descriptive label below each panel.
