# Here is what the image 1 in slide 13 of lecture 7 contains:

The image contains a plot titled "Side-By-Side (Comparative) Boxplots" with a subtitle "Age of Best Actor/Actress Oscar Winners (1970-2001)." The plot displays two boxplots side by side, labeled "actor" and "actress" on the x-axis, which is labeled "Gender." The y-axis is labeled "Age" and ranges from 20 to 80, marked at intervals of 10 (20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80).

Both boxplots show similar structures:
- The "actor" boxplot:
  - The box extends from approximately 40 to 50 on the y-axis.
  - A horizontal line inside the box indicates the median at 45.
  - Vertical lines, or whiskers, extend from the box to approximately 35 (lower whisker) and 60 (upper whisker).
  - There are two asterisks (*) above the upper whisker at y-values around 70 and 80.
- The "actress" boxplot:
  - The box extends from around 35 to 50 on the y-axis.
  - A horizontal line inside the box indicates the median at 40.
  - Whiskers extend from the box to about 30 (lower whisker) and 55 (upper whisker).
  - There are two asterisks (*) above the upper whisker at similar y-values around 70 and 80.

Below the plot, there are three bullet points:
- "boxplot(x) creates a box plot of data in x."
- "If x is a vector--> box."
- "If x is a matrix --> one box/column of x."
