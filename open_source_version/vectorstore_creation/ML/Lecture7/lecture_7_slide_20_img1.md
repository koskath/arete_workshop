# Here is what the image 1 in slide 20 of lecture 7 contains:

KNN outlier detection:

- Text at the top left:
  - "KNN outlier detection:"
  - A bulleted list follows:
    - "For each point, compute the average distance to its KNN." ("average distance" is in red)
    - "Sort the set of ‘n’ average distances."
    - "Choose the biggest values as outliers."
    - "Filter out points that are far from their KNNs."

- Scatter plot at the bottom right:
  - The plot is enclosed in a light gray grid with x and y axes.
  - X-axis ranges approximately from -17 to 12.
  - Y-axis ranges approximately from -12 to 13.
  - X-axis is labeled "X-Axis" and y-axis is labeled "Y-Axis."
  - The plot contains numerous small green dots clustered in specific areas.
  - There are large red circles scattered across the plot, some near clusters, others more isolated.
  - The green dots form visibly denser clusters near certain regions, while red circles are spread more sparsely.
  - Some regions with red circles do not have nearby clusters of green dots, indicating potential outliers.
