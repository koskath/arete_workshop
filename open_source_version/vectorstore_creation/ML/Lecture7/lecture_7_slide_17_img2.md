# Here is what the image 2 in slide 17 of lecture 7 contains:

The image contains a series of black clusters, small black dots, and larger red-circled points on a white background:

1. **Clusters and Points**:
   - The image has multiple clusters of densely packed black dots.
   - There are eight notable clusters in total, with varying sizes and densities.

2. **Annotations**:
   - In the top-left corner, a small black dot is encircled with a red circle and labeled with a red handwritten text: "'global' outlier".
   - In the center-left, a medium dense cluster is partially encircled, with a red oval highlighting some of the interior points.
   - In the bottom-left, a very dense cluster is partially outlined with a red handwritten oval.
   - In the lower-center, a small black dot is surrounded by a red circle, and another black cluster is surrounded by a red handwritten oval. This part is labeled with red handwritten text: "'local' outlier".
   - Towards the top-right, a dense cluster is outlined with a red oval and labeled with red handwritten text: "outliers 'group'".

3. **Text**:
   - Below the clusters, black printed text reads:
     - "Density-based clustering:"
     - A bullet point beneath states: "Outliers are points not assigned to cluster."

4. **Spatial Relationships**:
   - The clusters and outliers appear scattered across the image without overlapping.
   - The annotations use red circles and handwritten red text to emphasize specific points or clusters.

The drawing style of the annotations is informal, with freehand ovals and arrows pinpointing the relevant features within the image.
