# Here is what the image 1 in slide 25 of lecture 7 contains:

The image consists of two separate diagrams, each representing a tree-like structure with nodes and arrows.

**Left Diagram:**
1. At the top is a blue circular node containing the number "256."
2. Below the node is a horizontal bar, divided into a light green and a darker green section. On the left, it's labeled "min \( x_2 \)" and on the right, "max \( x_2 \)."
3. Below the bar, there are two arrows pointing downward, each leading to a blue circular node.
   - The left arrow points to a node labeled "45."
   - The right arrow points to a node labeled "211."
4. Curved lines are connecting the "256" node to the ends of the bar, indicating a relationship. 

**Right Diagram:**
1. At the top is a blue circular node containing the number "256," similar to the left diagram.
2. Two arrows, leading from the "256" node, branch into two separate paths:
   - The left arrow points to a blue node labeled "45."
   - The right arrow points to a blue node labeled "211."
3. The "45" node has two arrows extending from it:
   - One leads to a red circular node labeled "1."
   - The other leads to a blue circular node labeled "44."
4. Dotted lines extend downward beneath the "1" and "44" nodes, indicating continuation.
5. The "211" node also has two arrows extending from it:
   - One leads to a blue circular node labeled "190."
   - The other leads to a blue circular node labeled "21."
6. The "21" node has two arrows:
   - One leads to a blue circular node labeled "20."
   - The other leads to a red circular node labeled "1."
7. Below the "190," "20," and the second "1" nodes are dotted lines, indicating continuation.

**Additional Elements:**
- Between the two diagrams are three vertical ellipses, suggesting omitted content or continuation.
