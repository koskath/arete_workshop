# Slide 52 of Lecture 7 contains information about the SMOTE.

SMOTE takes samples of the feature space for each target class and its nearest neighbors, then generates new examples that combine features of the target case with features of its neighbors, which increases the features available to each class and makes the samples more general; SMOTE takes the entire dataset as input but increases the percentage of only the minority cases.
