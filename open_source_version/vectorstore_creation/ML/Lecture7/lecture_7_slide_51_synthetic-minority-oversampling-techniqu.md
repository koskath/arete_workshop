# Slide 51 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique.

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) primarily analyzes the under-represented class and increases the number of cases in the dataset in a balanced way by generating new instances from existing minority cases; class imbalance often occurs due to rare values or difficulty in collecting data, and SMOTE oversamples the minority class by processing each minority class sample and creating synthetic examples along line segments joining any or all of the k minority class nearest neighbors.
