# Here is what the image 1 in slide 15 of lecture 7 contains:

The image is a box plot diagram annotated with various statistical concepts. The central feature is a rectangular box, outlined in dark red, representing the interquartile range (IQR). The left edge of the box is marked as "Q1" (first quartile), and the right edge is marked as "Q3" (third quartile). A vertical red line inside the box indicates the "Median."

Above the box, an arrow with horizontal lines at both ends is labeled "IQR," spanning from Q1 to Q3. To the left and right of the box are horizontal lines, or "whiskers," extending outward. 

- The left whisker ends at a point labeled "Q1 - 1.5 × IQR," with a small vertical line marking the endpoint of the whisker. 
- The right whisker ends at "Q3 + 1.5 × IQR," similarly marked with a small vertical line. 

Beneath the box plot is a horizontal axis labeled with negative and positive sigma (σ) values, indicating standard deviations:

- To the left, it is labeled from "−4σ" to "−1σ" at regular intervals.
- To the right, it is labeled from "0σ" to "4σ."

Dotted vertical lines extend from the axis to intersect the points where the whiskers end on the plot above. The median line in the box is aligned with "0σ" on the horizontal axis. All text and lines are in a dark red color.
