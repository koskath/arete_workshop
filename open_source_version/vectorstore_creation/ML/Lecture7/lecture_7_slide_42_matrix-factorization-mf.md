# Slide 42 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Matrix Factorization (MF).

Collaborative filtering by matrix factorization is an efficient and effective approach that defines both a model and an objective function, typically optimized using stochastic gradient descent; classes of matrix factorization include unconstrained matrix factorization, singular value decomposition (SVD), and non-negative matrix factorization, and these methods work well with implicit feedback like Facebook's Like button (without a Dislike option) or Pinterest pins.
