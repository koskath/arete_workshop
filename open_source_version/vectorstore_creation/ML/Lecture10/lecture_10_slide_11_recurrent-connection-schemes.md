# Slide 11 of Lecture 10 contains information about the Recurrent Connection Schemes.

Slide 11 highlights two main schemes for forming recurrent connections from one recurrent layer to another: linking hidden units directly to other hidden units, which better captures high-dimensional features from the past, and linking the output of the previous layer back to the current hidden unit, which is comparatively easy to compute and parallelize.
