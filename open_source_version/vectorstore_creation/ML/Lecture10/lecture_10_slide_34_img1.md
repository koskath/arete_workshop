# Here is what the image 1 in slide 34 of lecture 10 contains:

The image presents a flowchart depicting a sequence of operations. 

1. At the top, a rounded rectangle filled with a light purple color and outlined in black contains the text "ReLU".
   - An arrow points upward from the next element to this box.

2. Below "ReLU", another rounded rectangle, similarly styled, contains the text "Add".
   - An arrow points upward from the next element to this box.

3. Below "Add", another rounded rectangle, similarly styled, contains the text "MatMul".
   - Two arrows, left and right at the bottom of this box, point downward toward two elements.

4. To the left below "MatMul", a circle filled with a light blue color and outlined in black contains the letter "W".
   - An arrow points from this circle to the left-bottom of "MatMul".

5. To the right below "MatMul", another circle filled with a light green color and outlined in black contains the letter "x".
   - An arrow points from this circle to the right-bottom of "MatMul".

6. To the left of "Add", a circle filled with a light blue color and outlined in black contains the letter "b".
   - An arrow points from this circle to the left-bottom of "Add".

The arrows are all black, indicating directionality from one element to another, establishing the flow of operations, starting from "W" and "x", passing through "MatMul" and "b", moving through "Add", and ending at "ReLU".
