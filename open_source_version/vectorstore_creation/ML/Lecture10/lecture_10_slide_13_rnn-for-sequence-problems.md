# Slide 13 of Lecture 10 contains information about the RNN for Sequence Problems.

Slide 13 introduces the encoder–decoder, or sequence-to-sequence, architecture in which a sequence of words in one language serves as the input and a sequence of words in another language becomes the output, enabling machine translation and speech recognition.

It also covers synchronized sequence input to output settings, such as labeling each video frame in a stream for video classification, where the model must emit aligned predictions at every time step.
