# Here is what the image 1 in slide 36 of lecture 10 contains:

The image consists of a flowchart diagram with various components, annotations, and directional arrows on a dual-colored background, divided horizontally.

1. **Background:**
   - The upper half is shaded in yellow and labeled "GPU 0."
   - The lower half is shaded in light blue and labeled "CPU."

2. **Components and Annotations:**
   - **Left side (Blue region):**
     - A black-edged white rectangle labeled "biases."
     - A pair of black-edged white squares with ellipses ("...") indicating continuation.
     - A black-edged white rectangle labeled "learning rate."

   - **Middle section (Yellow region):**
     - An oval labeled "Add."
     - A white oval with an ellipse ("...") indicating continuation.
     - An oval labeled "Mul."

   - **Right side (Blue region):**
     - An oval labeled "Assign Sub."

3. **Arrows and Directionality:**
   - Arrows originate from "biases" and point to both "Add" and "Assign Sub."
   - An arrow leads from the first ellipses ("...") to "Add."
   - An arrow from "Add" points to the middle ellipses ("...").
   - An arrow originates from the middle ellipses ("...") leading to "Mul."
   - An arrow leads from "learning rate" to "Mul."
   - An arrow points from "Mul" to "Assign Sub."

4. **Text:**
   - At the very bottom, in red capital letters, the text reads "CPUS & GPUS."

The diagram appears to represent a process flow involving components within a computational system, with inputs, operations, and outputs assigned to specified hardware architectures.
