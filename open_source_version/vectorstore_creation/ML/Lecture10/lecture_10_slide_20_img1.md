# Here is what the image 1 in slide 20 of lecture 10 contains:

The image consists of two sections, "Define" and "Run," each contained within a rounded rectangle bordered with a green line.

**Define Section:**
- Title: "Define," located at the top left inside the rounded rectangle.
- Components arranged horizontally with arrows indicating flow:
  - A box labeled "Network definition" on the left. An arrow points from this box to the right.
  - A box labeled "Computational graph" in the center, receiving the arrow from "Network definition." Another arrow points from this box to the right.
  - A box labeled "Gradient function" on the right, receiving the arrow from "Computational graph."
- Above "Computational graph," there's a box labeled "Parameters," with a line extending down to connect with "Computational graph."
- A green arrow originates from "Parameters" pointing to the left between "Network definition" and "Computational graph."
- Annotation below: "Auto differentiation," positioned beneath "Computational graph" and "Gradient function," spanning both horizontally.

**Run Section:**
- Title: "Run," located at the top left inside the rounded rectangle.
- Components arranged horizontally with arrows indicating flow:
  - A cylinder on the left labeled "Training data." An arrow points from this cylinder to the right.
  - A box labeled "Computational graph" in the center, receiving the arrow from "Training data." An arrow points from this box to the right.
  - A box labeled "Gradient function" on the right, receiving the arrow from "Computational graph."
- Above "Computational graph," there's a box labeled "Parameters," with a line extending down to connect with "Computational graph."
- An arrow originates from "Parameters" pointing to the left between "Training data" and "Computational graph."
- A curved arrow starts from "Gradient function," arcs over "Computational graph," and ends at a box labeled "Update" located above "Gradient function."
- Annotation below: "Loss & gradient," positioned beneath "Computational graph" and "Gradient function," spanning both horizontally.

Both sections are visually and structurally similar in layout.
