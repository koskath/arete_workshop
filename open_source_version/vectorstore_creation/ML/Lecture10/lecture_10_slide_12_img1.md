# Here is what the image 1 in slide 12 of lecture 10 contains:

- The image is divided into two main sections, each representing a different type of neural network processing.

**Left Section:**
- A bullet point text description at the top reads: "An input to a sequence of output: when an image is passed as an input to network, and output is a sequence of words" with "(Image captioning problem)" in red.
- Below the text, there is a horizontal sequence of three connected rectangles, each labeled "Memory cells."
- The first rectangle on the left has an arrow pointing up to a blue circle labeled "Output."
- Below this rectangle, a green circle labeled "Input" has an arrow pointing up to the rectangle.
- The rectangles are connected by rightward arrows, indicating a sequence, and there is an ellipsis after the third rectangle, suggesting continuation.

**Right Section:**
- A bullet point text description reads: "A sequence of inputs to an output: Pass a sequence of words as input to the network, and output is a class indicating either a positive or negative review or sentiment" with "(Sentiment Analysis)" in red.
- Below this text, there is a horizontal sequence of three connected rectangles, each labeled "Memory cells."
- Below this sequence, an ellipsis indicates continuation to the left, leading to the first rectangle.
- Each rectangle has an upward arrow pointing to a blue circle labeled "Output."
- The last rectangle on the right has a downward arrow coming from a green circle labeled "Input."

- The overall layout consists of alternating green and blue circular labels clearly differentiating between inputs and outputs, with arrows indicating the flow of information through memory cells.
