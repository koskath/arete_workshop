# Here is what the image 1 in slide 22 of lecture 10 contains:

The image consists of a structured diagram with several mathematical expressions, text labels, shapes, and arrows.

1. **Top Left:**
   - The expression "argminᵪ f(ᵪ)" is presented in black text. An arrow points right to a rectangular box on the right containing the text "Solved via optimization procedure, e.g. stochastic gradient descent (SGD)." The words "optimization procedure" and "stochastic gradient descent" are in bold.

2. **Middle Left:**
   - Below the first expression, another formula in black text reads:
     - "f(ᵪ) = Σᵢ=1ᴹ loss(ᵪ, exᵢ)" where the summation runs from i = 1 to M. An arrow points to the right to a rectangular box containing the text "Notion of 'quality,' e.g. squared distance." The words "quality" and "squared distance" are in bold.

3. **Lower Middle Left:**
   - The text "model ᵪ" is displayed in black, bold text. An arrow points to the right to a rectangular box with the text "E.g., neural network or linear model." The words "neural network" and "linear model" are in bold.

4. **Bottom Left:**
   - A blue rectangular box contains the word "Task" in white text.
   - Below this rectangle, a cloud shape contains the word "Data" in black text. 
   - An arrow originates from the word "Task" and points right to a rectangular box with the text "E.g., classification." The word "classification" is in bold.

5. **General Layout:**
   - The image has a series of arrows running horizontally from left to right, connecting each element to its corresponding box with additional information on the right.
   - The background is white, and all arrows are blue, matching the outline of the right-hand boxes. The task box is also in blue with white text, while the remainder of the text is black, except where specifically noted as bold.
