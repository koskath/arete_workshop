# Slide 9 of Lecture 10 contains information about the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

Slide 9 explains that a recurrent computational graph formalizes an RNN as an unfolded graph so that the information flow through the recurrent layer at every time instant becomes explicit.

Using a sequence of five time steps as an example, we unfold the recurrent neuron five times across the instants to illustrate how the same parameters operate repeatedly throughout the sequence.​
