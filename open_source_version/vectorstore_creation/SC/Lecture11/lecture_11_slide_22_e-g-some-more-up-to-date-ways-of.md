# Slide 22 of Lecture 11 contains information about … e.g. some more up-to-date ways of Handling „C-Parts“

This slide illustrates a modernized approach to managing "C-Parts"—typically low-value, high-volume consumables—by integrating a traditional KANBAN system with digital barcode scanning technology. The process is depicted as a closed-loop cycle divided into two parallel streams: an "Information flow" and a "Physical Flow." The cycle begins when a bin on the storage rack becomes empty; this empty box, which carries a specific barcode, serves as the immediate signal for replenishment. Instead of manual counting or paper ordering, a worker scans this barcode using a handheld device, which instantly transmits the data to the central computer system. This digital trigger initiates the physical logistics work: the order is received, and boxes are filled at a central warehouse or supplier facility, shown here utilizing automated conveyors. These replenished goods are then transported back to the point of use—indicated as a "Weekly delivery"—where the supply stock is physically refilled on the racks. The loop is continuous, with empty bins being returned to the supplier to be refilled again, effectively automating the reordering process and minimizing the administrative burden associated with managing thousands of small, inexpensive items.
