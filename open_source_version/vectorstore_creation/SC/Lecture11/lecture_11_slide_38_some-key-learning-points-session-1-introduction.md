Content:
Some key learning points from Session 1, Introduction to logistics and supply chain management, relate to both content and literature. In terms of content, the session provides an introduction to the course, discusses the evolution of logistics and SCM, examines key logistics activities and components, and considers the grand purpose of supply chain management. The literature includes Kopczak, L. R. and Johnson, M. Eric (2003): “The Supply‑Chain Management Effect”, MIT Sloan Management Review, Vol. 44, No. 3, pp. 27‑34, and Bowersox, Donald (2007): “SCM: The past is prologue”, in CSCMP's Supply Chain Quarterly, 2/2007, pp. 1‑7.
Some broad questions that address the main issues of SCManagement are also raised. These questions include “What is Logistics/SCM; what is the difference?” and “What means ‘managing’ a Supply Chain?”, and they invite reflection on system, flow and network thinking in logistics and SCM, on the functional versus holistic view, and on the footprints of modern logistics and SCM.
