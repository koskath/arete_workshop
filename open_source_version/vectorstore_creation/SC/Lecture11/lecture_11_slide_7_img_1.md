  3. (blank line)

The right half of the large circle is labeled "Pure thinking & application." It contains:
- An illustration of a person wearing a "THINKING CAP" that is blue with a light bulb on top. The person is drawn with simplified facial features and an expression labeled "Whoa."
- An illustration of a cartoonish character, with a green hat, green shirt, and blue overalls, inspecting or using a giant magnifying glass to look at a round hole in the ground.

The overall background of the large circle is a speckled gray texture, giving it a shaded appearance.
