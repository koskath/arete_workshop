# Slide 44 of Lecture 11 contains information about Key learning points: Session 7 Management
of International Sales and Goods Flows
Content: Literature:
Key learning points from Session 7, Management of International Sales and Goods Flows, relate to content and literature on trade facilitation and international operations. The content covers economic integration levels and trade facilitation, what you need to know for export and import operations, Lex Mercatoria and trade terms, and international procedural law and law of sales contracts. The literature includes Grainger, A. (2011): “Trade Facilitation: A Conceptual Review”, Journal of World Trade, Vol. 45, No. 1, pp. 39‑62, and TFG (2020): “Incoterms® 2020 Rules”, Trade Finance Global.
Main issues:
Some broad questions that address the main issues include “How does economic integration and/or trade facilitation ease international sales and goods flows?”, “How can you spend less on duties and taxes upon importation to, for example, the EU?” and “Which Incoterm® 2020 is favourable for exporters or importers and why?”. These questions are linked to main issues such as economic integration levels (for example, customs union versus free trade area), customs procedures in the context of the EU, and an overview of Incoterms® including their definition, rules and obligations of buyer and seller and the applicability of certain Incoterms®.
