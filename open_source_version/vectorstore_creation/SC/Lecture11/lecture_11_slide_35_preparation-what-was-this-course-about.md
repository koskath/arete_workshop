# Slide 35 of Lecture 11 contains information about Preparation - What was this course about
Key objective of the course is to introduce students into the business challenges and
solutions of supply chain management and modern business logistics in a global
environment. Students should learn to identify and understand specific basic and
global supply chain management problems and relate it to theories, methods, and
justifiable solutions. For the application and discussion of solutions they should akquire
knowledge on concepts, structures, tools and processes, which are necessary for the
management of global supply chains as well as on there application context of global
supply chain management issues. Finally the students should learn to demonstrate
theuse of“flow thinking”and SCM terminology thatis centraltothis course.
More specifically, students should be able to identify management issues, both physical and technical and managerial and behavioural, in global supply chains and logistics operations and relate them to key theories, models and concepts of supply chain management and modern business logistics. They should be able to suggest ways of factoring complexity into business situations arising from international business and inter‑organisational relationships in operations such as logistics, sourcing and production. They should also be able to apply basic theoretical ideas and concepts by using taught methods such as mapping global supply chains in terms of flows and scope and by demonstrating comprehension of SCM concepts and terminology. Finally, they should be able to distinguish challenges in global procurement, production and logistics issues and to analyse, both qualitatively and quantitatively, basic trade‑offs such as global supplier, site and transport mode selection. 12.03.2025 Slide 35
