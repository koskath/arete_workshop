Language
The exam is held in English, but it is not an English language exam. Some points are worth remembering: use easily understood language and at the same time demonstrate command of technical terminology and good academic style; the assignment is not improved by throwing in foreign words unnecessarily. Use short sentences, because long sentences increase the risk of confusion and ambiguity. Spend time proofreading and checking your work, and be consistent in your argumentation and in your use of language. 12.03.2025 Slide 33
