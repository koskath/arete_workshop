# Slide 20 of Lecture 7 contains information about Release into Free Circulation and Status of Goods

This image explains two related customs concepts:  
**(1) Release into Free Circulation** and **(2) Status of Goods (Union vs. Non-Union goods)**.  
It uses text and icons (EU flag, Chinese flag, arrows, gears) to illustrate how goods acquire Union status after importation or processing.


## Release into Free Circulation
The left side of the image describes the legal meaning of *release into free circulation*:
- All **duties and taxes** are paid on **non-community goods** (e.g., imports from China).  
- After this, goods may circulate freely within the EU, with or without customs surveillance (depending on the type of goods and their end-use).

### Diagram (Top Right)

A visual sequence shows:
1. A **Chinese flag** representing imported non-Union goods entering the EU.  
2. The goods go through **Release into Free Circulation** (indicated with an icon showing euro symbols).  
3. After this step, the goods receive an **EU flag**, symbolizing that they now have **Union status**.  
4. An optional arrow leads to **Processing in the EU** (shown with gear icons).  
5. Goods processed in the EU also receive the **EU flag**, indicating Union status.

## Status of Goods
### Non-Union Goods
- Goods originating from **non-EU (third) countries** → represented by the **Chinese flag**.

### Union Goods
Union goods include:
1. **Non-Union goods after release into free circulation**  
   Icon: Chinese flag → EU flag
2. **Goods made in the EU using (Non-)Union goods**  
   Icon: Chinese flag + EU flag → EU flag
3. **Goods fully raised or produced in the EU from Union goods**  
   Icon: EU flag → EU flag  

### Important Note
- The **Country of Origin** or heritage of goods normally **does not change**, even when goods become Union goods after importation or processing.


# Overall Purpose
The slide explains how imported goods acquire **Union status** after paying duties or after being processed in the EU, and clarifies the distinction between **Union** and **Non-Union** goods under EU customs law.
