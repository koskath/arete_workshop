# Slide 7 of Lecture 7 contains information about Summary: Supranational European Bodies and Economic Integration

The image is a complex, layered diagram illustrating how various European countries participate in different **supranational organizations**, **economic unions**, and **political cooperation frameworks**. Each organization is shown as a colored boundary that encloses the member states, represented by their national flags.

## Main Elements of the Diagram

### 1. **European Political Community**
A large outer blue frame that includes many European countries, representing broad political cooperation.

### 2. **Council of Europe**
A purple boundary that covers nearly all European states, showing membership in the continent’s main human-rights and democracy institution.

### 3. **Schengen Area**
A red frame that includes EU and non-EU members allowing passport-free travel.

### 4. **European Union (EU)**
A dark blue boundary showing the EU member countries. Inside it overlap several more specific groups.

### 5. **Sub-groups within or around the EU**
- **Nordic Council** (Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Norway)  
- **Visegrád Group** (Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary)  
- **Baltic Assembly** (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania)  
- **Benelux** (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg)

### 6. **EFTA and EEA**
- **EFTA** (green-orange label): Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein  
- **EEA**: EU + most EFTA members (excludes Switzerland)

### 7. **Eurozone**
Countries in green participating in the common currency (the euro).

### 8. **EU Customs Union**
Countries participating in the common customs regulation (orange boundary).

### 9. **Monetary Agreements with the EU**
Small green box showing non-EU microstates using the euro through agreements (e.g., Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, Vatican City).

### 10. **Common Travel Area**
The UK and Ireland shown in a red small frame.

### 11. **Organizations in Eastern and Southeastern Europe**
- **CEFTA** (Central European Free Trade Agreement)  
- **Open Balkan** (Serbia, Albania, North Macedonia)  
- **GUAM** (Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Moldova)  
- **BSEC** (Black Sea Economic Cooperation, including Turkey, Russia, and Balkan states)  
- **Union State** (Russia–Belarus)

### 12. **Side Panels**
On the right side of the slide, there are four smaller diagrams showing similar supranational structure maps for **other regions of the world**, including:
- South/Southeast Asia  
- Post-Soviet organizations  
- Africa and the Middle East  
- Pacific/ANZUS/SPC frameworks  

These serve as contextual comparisons but are not the main focus.
