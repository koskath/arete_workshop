# Slide 24 of Lecture 7 contains information about Forms of Customs Transit Procedures

This chart provides an overview of the different types of **customs transit procedures** used to move goods across borders without immediately paying duties or taxes. The diagram is organized hierarchically, beginning with the umbrella category "Customs Transit Procedures" and branching into specific systems used in the EU and internationally.

## Overall Structure

At the top of the chart is a single box labelled **Customs Transit Procedures**, which represents the general category of systems that allow goods to move across customs territories under suspension of duties.
From this central box, the diagram splits into **three main branches**:
1. **Other Transit Procedures**  
2. **Common Transit (EU)**  
3. **Union Transit (COM)**
Each branch represents a legal or operational framework governing how goods can transit through various territories.

## Other Transit Procedures (Left Branch)
This branch covers transit systems that apply to the movement of goods through countries that are parties to specific transit conventions. The box leads to **Carnet T.I.R.**, which stands for *Transport International de Marchandises par Véhicules Routier* (International Road Transport).
The **TIR system** allows goods to move across multiple borders under a single transit document and sealed load compartments, simplifying long-distance road transport across many contracting countries.


## Common Transit (EU) (Middle Branch)
The middle section of the chart describes **Common Transit**, used for goods moving:
- between the **EU** and **EFTA** countries (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein), or  
- within the EU but transiting through EFTA states.

The red text lists additional countries that participate in the Common Transit system:
- Turkey (since 2012)  
- North Macedonia (since 2015)  
- Serbia (since 2016)  
- United Kingdom (joined 30.01.2019)  
- Ukraine (since 01.10.2022)  
- Georgia (since 01.01.2025)

From this branch, the chart links downward to two transit types used within the EU customs framework:
- **External Transit Procedure (T1)** – used for **Non-Union Goods**  
- **Internal Transit Procedure (T2)** – used for **Union Goods**
These codes (T1 and T2) appear on transit documents to distinguish whether the goods remain under non-Union or Union status.

## Union Transit (COM) (Right Branch)
The third branch shows **Union Transit**, a system applied:
- for the movement of goods **within the EU**, or  
- between the EU and the microstates **Andorra** or **San Marino**.
This procedure ensures that goods can circulate inside the Union or associated customs territories without repeated customs checks at internal borders. Union Transit also links downward to the **T1/T2** structure described above.


# Summary
This chart provides a concise overview of the main frameworks governing customs transit:
- **TIR** for broader international road transport.  
- **Common Transit** for coordinated EU–EFTA transit and participating partner countries.  
- **Union Transit** for goods circulating within the EU or between the EU and small associated customs territories.

Together, these systems enable the smooth movement of goods across borders while deferring duty payment and minimizing administrative barriers.
