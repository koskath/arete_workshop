# Slide 33 of Lecture 7 contains information about International Procedural Law and Law of Sales Contracts
International procedural law serves as the fall‑back solution whenever nothing else is agreed upon in a sales contract through specific clauses, such as a choice of law, venue, arbitration or mediation. In this field, each country autonomously regulates in its international procedural law which system of law is the proper law of a contract and which courts have jurisdiction to hear a case concerning parties from different countries. The overall principle is that the proper law of a contract is the system of law by reference to which the contract was made or that with which the transaction has its closest and most real connection, as laid down in the Rome Convention of 1980.  
Uniform law of sales contracts is provided by the Vienna Convention (the UNCITRAL Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, CISG) of 1980, which forms a uniform law of sales contracts, apart from some exclusions for special cases. In 1990, the CISG acquired the status of national law in Denmark, with some reservations concerning Articles 92 and 94 (e.g. for Inter‑Nordic trade). The CISG can be applied only if the parties have their place of business in different countries and both are contracting states of the CISG and/or the rules of their private international law lead to the application of the law of a contracting state. The application of the CISG can be excluded by an explicit arrangement, although this is not generally recommended. 33
