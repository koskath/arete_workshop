# Slide 25 of Lecture 7 contains information about Common and Union Transit Statistics
This slide presents a real-time overview of **Common Transit** and **Union Transit** movements within Europe. It combines statistical bar charts with a color-coded geographic map, reflecting how transit flows move through EU and Common Transit Convention (CTC) member states.

## Left Side: Transit Movements Statistics (Bar Chart)
On the left, the slide displays a vertical bar chart showing **transit movements by country**, filtered for:
- **Country:** Austria (selected)
- **Movement type:** Departure
- **Period:** Last half hour
- **Refresh rate:** Every 15 minutes

The chart lists European countries along with the number of transit movements recorded during this time window. Each country is associated with a bar indicating volume, as well as a small flag for quick visual identification.
Examples from the chart include:
- **Germany:** 357 movements  
- **Netherlands:** 298 movements  
- **Switzerland:** 214 movements  
- **Italy:** 167 movements  
- **Belgium:** 161 movements  
- **Poland:** 132 movements  
- **Spain:** 113 movements  

Other countries show smaller numbers, ranging from single-digit traffic to moderate volumes. These figures represent **transit declarations** departing from Austria and processed through the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS).
Below the chart, a note explains technical gateway connections:
- Andorra is routed through Belgium  
- San Marino through Italy  
- Iceland through Norway  
- Liechtenstein through Switzerland
The slide also indicates the **last update timestamp:** 17-02-2025 at 12:05.


## Right Side: Geographic Map of Transit Participation
The map on the right provides a visual overview of countries participating in the **EU Transit** and **Common Transit Convention** systems.
Using a color-coded legend:
- **Dark Blue:** EU Member States  
- **Medium Blue:** CTC Contracting Parties (non-EU)  
- **Light Blue:** CTC Parties under preparation  
- **Pink:** The country currently selected (Austria)

Flags placed on each country reinforce identification and match the country list on the bar chart.
Countries like Norway, Switzerland, Serbia, North Macedonia, Turkey, and the UK (post-Brexit) are visible as **Common Transit members**, demonstrating that the transit system extends well beyond the EU.

## Overall Purpose
This slide visually combines **live digital transit statistics** with **geographical context** to show how intensively goods move across Europe under the EU/CTC transit systems. It highlights the central role of Austria (selected in this view) within European transit flows and demonstrates how the New Computerised Transit System efficiently connects both EU and non-EU countries.
