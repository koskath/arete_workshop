# Slide 35 of Lecture 7 contains information about Rules Concerning

Obligations, Risks and Costs
A – Rules for Sellers  
B – Rules for Buyers  
In Incoterms®, the rules concerning obligations, risks and costs are split between the seller (A‑clauses) and the buyer (B‑clauses). For sellers, the clauses A1 to A10 cover the general obligations of the seller, delivery (where and how), transfer of risks, carriage, insurance, delivery/transport documents, export/transit/import clearance, checking/packaging/marking, allocation of costs and notices to the buyer. For buyers, the corresponding clauses B1 to B10 cover the general obligations of the buyer, taking delivery, transfer of risks, carriage, insurance, delivery/transport documents, export/transit/import clearance, checking/packaging/marking, allocation of costs and notices to the seller. However, Incoterms® do not regulate the specification of the goods sold, the price to be paid, the method of payment, the transfer of title or the consequences of a breach of contract.
