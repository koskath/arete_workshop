# Slide 13 of Lecture 7 contains information about The Importation (Exportation) Procedure
The importation and exportation procedure offers several possibilities depending on the origin, quality and nature of a good. In the simplest case there are no importation or exportation restrictions, and therefore no permit or licence is needed. In other cases, importation or exportation may be subject to a permit or licence, for example according to an Importation List or Exportation List or under other import or export regulations; typical examples include military and dual-use goods, technology, artworks, plants and animals, medicines and certain chemicals such as explosives. There are also simplified importation and exportation procedures, where a pre-declaration is lodged in the form of an Entry Summary Declaration (ENS) or an Exit Summary Declaration (EXS).
