# Slide 27 of Lecture 7 contains information about Tarif Intégré de la Communauté (TARIC)
TARIC, the online integrated Union Tariff, is a multilingual database in which all measures relating to EU customs tariff, commercial and agricultural legislation are integrated. It contains a number of main categories of measures (in a non‑exhaustive list), including tariff measures, agricultural measures and trade defence instruments. It also covers prohibitions and restrictions on imports and exports, as well as the surveillance of movements of goods at import and export. Further information and consultation of TARIC are available at `http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/taric/taric_consultation.jsp`. 27
