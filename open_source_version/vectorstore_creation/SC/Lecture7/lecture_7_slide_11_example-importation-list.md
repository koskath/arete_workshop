# Slide 11 of Lecture 7 contains information about Example: Importation List from former German AWV

The image shows a scanned excerpt from an **importation list** used under the former German AWV (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung – Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation). The document outlines goods subject to specific import regulations, including classification numbers, product descriptions, regulatory codes, and licensing requirements.

## Structure of the Table

The table is divided into **five main columns**:

1. **Warennummer (Commodity Number)**  
   Numerical customs or tariff code used to classify the goods (e.g., 6212 10 00, 6212 20 00).

2. **Warenbezeichnung (Description of Goods)**  
   Detailed descriptions of the product categories—primarily textiles and clothing accessories in this example.  
   Example items shown include:  
   - Brassieres  
   - Corsets  
   - Girdles  
   - Ties  
   - Shawls and scarves  
   - Handkerchiefs  
   Subcategories are indicated with indentations (e.g., “— aus Seide” / “— aus Baumwolle”).

3. **Zuständigkeitsbereich (Jurisdiction Area)**  
   A numerical code (mostly "09") representing the responsible administrative area or regulatory classification.

4. **Genehmigungs- oder Listen­erfordernis (License or Listing Requirement)**  
   Contains multiple small superscript codes (such as **51), 21), 31)**), referring to regulatory notes, exceptions, or licensing obligations.  
   Letters like **U** and **UE** indicate approval requirements related to foreign trade controls.

5. **Bemerkungen (Remarks)**  
   Brief notes or indicators relevant to import permissions, restrictions, or exceptions.

## Additional Information at the Bottom

Footnotes expand on specific regulatory conditions. Examples:

- **Footnote 051**:  
  Indicates that importation requires authorization unless goods originate from South Korea, with further exceptions regarding hand-woven or hand-crafted textiles.

- **Footnote 052**:  
  Indicates importation requires authorization if goods originate from Hong Kong.

These notes clarify when an import license is required based on **country of origin** and **type of goods**.

# Overall Purpose of the Document

This former AWV import list served as a legal reference defining which textile goods required **import permits**, what regulatory exceptions applied, and how goods were classified for foreign trade administration.  
It represents a bureaucratic tool for controlling and monitoring textile imports under earlier German trade regulations.
