# The image 1 in slide 21 of lecture 7 contains:
The image depicts a flowchart for customs processing, structured in a rectangular layout with a light blue background. At the far left, there is an image of the U.S. flag. To the right, an arrow points towards a rectangular box labeled "Customs Warehousing." Inside this box, there is a bold circle icon with "No" across it, symbolizing prohibition.

Moving right, an arrow directs towards another box labeled "Public or private Warehouse." This box includes an icon resembling a warehouse with "ZOLL" and "DOUANE" written in white within a red circle, possibly indicating customs.

From the "Public or private Warehouse" box, there is an arrow pointing right towards another box that reads "Re-Exportation." This box shows another U.S. flag to the right. An arrow extends from this box, pointing to the right outside the main flowchart structure, followed by a large arrow heading off the image, possibly indicating export.

Beneath the "Public or private Warehouse," a downward arrow leads to a depiction of two overlapping flags (one U.S. and one EU). Below the flags is a box labeled "Release into free Circulation," which contains three overlapping coin symbols marked with the Euro symbol (€).

Overall, the chart represents a pathway from customs warehousing through possible re-exportation or release into circulation within Europe.
