# Slide 4 of Lecture 7 contains information about Legal Framework of Trade

The legal framework of trade is formed by norms and rules of international law and multinational treaties or agreements, which together build up a supra-national legal framework. This includes organisations and regimes such as the UNO, OECD, EEC/EC/EU and GATT/WTO, as well as bilateral commercial treaties and trade agreements. Alongside these, national regulations—mainly following national or regional interests—also play a major role, including external trade law and customs law. Furthermore, Lex Mercatoria encompasses national and multinational regulations that allow valid cross-border legal transactions and their enforcement. International procedural law and the law of sales contracts, together with regulations about cross-border enforcement of sentences, provide additional structure. Mediation and international arbitration offer alternatives to ordinary court litigation procedures in resolving cross-border trade disputes. 4
