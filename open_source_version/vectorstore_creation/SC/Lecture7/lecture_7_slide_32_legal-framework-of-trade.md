# Slide 32 of Lecture 7 contains information about Legal Framework of Trade

The legal framework of trade is shaped by norms and rules of international law and multinational treaties or agreements, which together build up a supra‑national legal framework. This includes organisations and regimes such as the UNO, OECD, EEC/EC/EU and GATT/WTO, as well as bilateral commercial treaties and trade agreements. In addition, national regulations—mainly following national or regional interests—play a central role, including external trade law and customs law. Lex Mercatoria comprises national and multinational regulations that allow valid cross‑border legal transactions and their enforcement. Furthermore, international procedural law and the law of sales contracts, along with regulations about cross‑border enforcement of sentences, provide the legal basis for resolving disputes, while mediation and international arbitration offer alternatives to ordinary court litigation procedures. 32
