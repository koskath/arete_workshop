# Slide 11 of Lecture 6 contains information about Managing Value and Risk – the Kraljik Matrix
Managing value and risk in procurement can be supported by the Kraljic Matrix, which classifies purchased items along two dimensions: profit impact and supply risk. The matrix distinguishes non-critical items and leverage items on the one hand, and bottleneck items and strategic items on the other hand. Non-critical items typically have a low profit impact and low supply risk, while leverage items have a high profit impact but relatively low supply risk. Bottleneck items show low profit impact but high supply risk, and strategic items are characterised by both high profit impact and high supply risk. This categorisation helps organisations to tailor their sourcing and supplier management strategies to the specific risk and value profile of each item. Source: Kraljic (1983). 

The image is a table with four columns and five rows, including the header row. The columns are labeled "Procurement focus," "Main tasks," "Required information," and "Decision level." Each of the four rows below the header corresponds to a category of items: Strategic items, Bottleneck items, Leverage items, and Noncritical items. Each category details specific information as follows:

1. **Strategic items:**
   - **Main tasks:** Accurate demand forecasting, detailed market research, development of long-term supply relationships, make-or-buy decisions, contract staggering, risk analysis, contingency planning, logistics, inventory, and vendor control.
   - **Required information:** Highly detailed market data, long-term supply and demand trend information, good competitive intelligence, industry cost curves.
   - **Decision level:** Top level (e.g., vice president, purchasing).

2. **Bottleneck items:**
   - **Main tasks:** Volume insurance (at cost premium if necessary), control of vendors, security of inventories, backup plans.
   - **Required information:** Medium-term supply/demand forecasts, very good market data, inventory costs, maintenance plans.
   - **Decision level:** Higher level (e.g., department heads).

3. **Leverage items:**
   - **Main tasks:** Exploitation of full purchasing power, vendor selection, product substitution, targeted pricing negotiations, contract/spot purchasing mix, order volume optimization.
   - **Required information:** Good market data, short- to medium-term demand planning, accurate vendor data, price/transport rate forecasts.
   - **Decision level:** Medium level (e.g., chief buyer).

4. **Noncritical items:**
   - **Main tasks:** Product standardization, order volume monitoring/optimization, efficient processing, inventory optimization.
   - **Required information:** Good market overview, short-term demand information, economic order quantity, inventory levels.
   - **Decision level:** Lower levels (e.g., buyers).

The table is divided with horizontal lines separating each item category, and each cell contains text aligned to the left. The structure is simple and organized for easy comparison between different procurement focuses.
