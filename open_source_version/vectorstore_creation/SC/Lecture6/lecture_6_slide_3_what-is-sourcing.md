# Slide 3 of Lecture 6 contains information about What is Sourcing?

Sourcing refers to practices aimed at finding, evaluating and engaging suppliers for acquiring goods and services. A sourcing strategy is then essentially a business case that helps an organization decide on the best way to procure resources.

Finally, contract duration and the potential for performance improvement and cost reduction are important elements of a sourcing strategy. 3
