The image is a table titled "Table 9.1 The difference between buying and selling." The table is divided into two columns under the headers "Buyer motivation" and "Supplier motivation."

Under "Buyer motivation," there are five bullet points, which are:

- Increase scope?
- Buyer power?
- Best service?
- Wants to limit risk?

Under "Supplier motivation," there are also five bullet points, which are:
- Wants the highest price?
- Decrease scope?
- Supplier power?
- Fit for purpose?
- Limit liabilities?

Each column contains a series of questions, emphasizing the contrasting motivations between buyers and suppliers. The layout is organized with clear separation between the two sections, and each bullet point is left-aligned under its respective header.
