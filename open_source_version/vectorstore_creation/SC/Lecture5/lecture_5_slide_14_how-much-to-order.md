# Slide 14 of Lecture 5 contains information about How much to order?

This slide addresses the question of how much to order by highlighting the trade-off between ordering costs and holding costs. As the order quantity \(Q\) increases, the number of orders per year decreases and thus ordering cost per year tends to decrease, whereas holding cost per year increases because, on average, more inventory is kept in stock. Conversely, smaller order quantities reduce holding cost but increase ordering cost, so an appropriate balance must be found. €
