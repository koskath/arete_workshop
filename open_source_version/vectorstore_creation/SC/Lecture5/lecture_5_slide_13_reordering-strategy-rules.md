# Slide 13 of Lecture 5 contains information about Reordering strategy rules

Reordering strategy rules specify how order quantities and timing decisions are made. In terms of order quantities, systems may use a fixed quantity \(Q\) or policies that always fill up to a target level \(S\). The \((s,Q)\) rule triggers an order of size \(Q\) whenever the inventory position falls to or below a reorder point \(s\), whereas the \((s,S)\) rule places an order that raises the inventory level back up to \(S\) whenever it hits or drops below \(s\). Similarly, time-based rules such as the \((t,Q)\) rule and the \((t,S)\) rule review inventory at fixed intervals \(t\), then either order a fixed quantity \(Q\) or fill up to level \(S\) depending on the chosen policy. Taken together, these rules answer the question of when to order and how much to order.
