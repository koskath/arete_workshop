# The image 1 in slide 8 of lecture 5 contains:
The image contains a table titled "Table 10.1 Reasons for holding inventory." The table is divided into two columns with headers:

1. **Buffer against uncertainty**
2. **Economic trade-offs**

Below these headers are a series of bullet points in each column, as follows:

- **Buffer against uncertainty**:
  - Maintain customer service levels for volatile demand
  - Hedge against price and exchange rate fluctuations
  - Protect against delivery lead-time variability
  - Buffer against unreliable supply sources
  - Buffer against seasonal demand and supply
  - Maintain supply of scarce supply
  - Provide cover for emergencies

- **Economic trade-offs**:
  - Production batch size
  - Transportation batch size
  - Transportation mode
  - Order quantity size
  - Order frequency duration
  - Bulk purchase savings
  - Supply price fluctuations

The table is bordered at the top by a single black line beneath the title and another horizontal line separates the column headers from the content below. The table does not have border lines on the sides or the bottom.
