# The image 1 in slide 23 of lecture 5 contains:
The image consists of three adjacent line graphs, each illustrating different demand patterns over time. 

1. **Left Graph (a): Constant Demand**
   - Axes: The vertical axis is labeled "Stock," and the horizontal axis is labeled "Time."
   - Graph Line: The line forms a repeating sawtooth pattern, with a consistent slope downward followed by a sharp upward movement.
   - Annotation: Below the graph, the text reads "(a) Constant Demand."

2. **Center Graph (b): Statistically Stable Demand**
   - Axes: The vertical axis is labeled "Stock," and the horizontal axis is labeled "Time," similarly positioned as in the left graph.
   - Graph Line: The line steps down in irregular blocks but maintains a generally stable pattern with periodic slight increases.
   - Annotation: Below the graph, the text reads "(b) Statistically Stable Demand."

3. **Right Graph (c): Statistically Unstable Demand**
   - Axes: The vertical axis is labeled "Stock," and the horizontal axis is labeled "Time," matching the other graphs.
   - Graph Line: The line shows erratic, irregular movements with both large and small downward and upward steps.
   - Annotation: Below the graph, the text reads "(c) Statistically Unstable Demand."

All graphs are uniformly styled, with simplistic line representations and similar axis labels.
