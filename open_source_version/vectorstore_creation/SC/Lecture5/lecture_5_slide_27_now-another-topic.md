# Slide 27 of Lecture 5 contains information about Now another Topic…


The image, titled "Now another Topic... Hands on:," presents a scenario for a practical, decision-making exercise in inventory management . The prompt sets up a problem where an employee is asked to "think about improving our inventory situation" using a table of information provided by their boss. The table lists several items, denoted by their Article #, along with their Consumption (demand over a period) and their Price (in Euro). This data provides the necessary inputs to perform an ABC analysis, which is the logical starting point for improving an inventory situation. By classifying inventory items based on their value (Consumption multiplied by Price), the student can identify the few high-value items (A-items) that require strict control and detailed forecasting, versus the many low-value items (C-items) that can be managed with simpler, less costly methods. The question, "What could you do, where would you start?," specifically directs the user to prioritize actions based on this value analysis to focus resources where they will have the greatest impact on total inventory costs.
