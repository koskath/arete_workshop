# Slide 9 of Lecture 5 contains information about Inventory Management

The purpose of inventory management is the development of relevant inventory strategies and the achievement of high inventory performance. At the same time, it aims at reducing inventory and related costs as much as possible while still maintaining responsiveness, high customer satisfaction and general operational capabilities. In order to reach these goals, several key decisions have to be made. These include determining the size of the inventory and the appropriate time of stock keeping, deciding when to reorder and what exactly triggers the decision, specifying how much to order or reorder and, finally, deciding where to locate how much inventory in the supply chain.
