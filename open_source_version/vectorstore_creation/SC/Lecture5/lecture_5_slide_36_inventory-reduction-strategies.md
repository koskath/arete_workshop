# Slide 36 of Lecture 5 contains information about Inventory Reduction Strategies

Inventory centralization: variation of total demand is reduced => inventory reduction according to square root rule, with lower safety stock levels needed at central location. Delayed product differentiation: reducing variation by combining demand at different points is the case of a manufacturer making multiple products => postponement / delayed product differentiation. Part commonality: attempts simply to reduce the number of different parts in a product range wherever possible => again postponement / delayed product differentiation. Transit inventory reduction: => reducing lead times for lower transit inventory costs.
