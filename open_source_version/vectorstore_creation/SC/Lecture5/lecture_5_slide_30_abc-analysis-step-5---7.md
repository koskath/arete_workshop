# Slide 30 of Lecture 5 contains information about ABC Analysis – Step 5 - 7

The image, titled "ABC Analysis – Step 5-7," builds directly upon the previous analytical steps to finalize the classification of inventory items and demonstrate the value of focusing control efforts. This phase of the analysis involves calculating and evaluating the cumulated percentage of both the item count (Consumption in %) and the Value consumption in %. By ranking the items based on their individual value percentage (as done in the previous step), the table allows for the standard ABC classification. Specifically, items are grouped into A-items (which typically account for a high percentage, often around 70-80%, of the total value but only a small percentage of the total unit count), B-items (moderate value and volume), and C-items (the majority of the items in unit count but only a small percentage of the total value). The table provides cumulative data that would be used to draw the classification lines, for example, noting a cumulative value percentage of 73.2% as a benchmark for the A and B items. The final column shows the Consumption Value per class in %, which summarizes the economic concentration for each group, thereby validating the principle that management efforts should be highly concentrated on the few high-value A-items identified in the initial ranking.
