# Slide 12 of Lecture 5 contains information about Order-Quantities

The image, titled "Reordering strategies: When to order how much?," illustrates four fundamental inventory control policies using graphs that plot inventory level against time, which are techniques to efficiently manage a business's stock of products and other goods. Maintaining the proper inventory levels allows companies to avoid shortages while simultaneously minimizing the costs associated with having too many items in storage. The key challenge addressed is determining both the timing and the quantity of an order. The strategies are classified across two dimensions: whether the Order-Quantity is Fixed ($Q$) or Variable (Always fillup to $S$), and whether the Time of Ordering is triggered by a defined inventory level (the Reorder Point $s$) or a defined cycle time $t$. The graphs visually depict the Sawtooth Effect, showing inventory levels decline as demand is met and rise sharply when an order is received. For example, the Fixed Quantity $Q$ strategy can involve ordering the fixed amount only when the inventory drops to the Reorder Point $s$, resulting in variable time between orders, or ordering the fixed amount at a fixed cycle time $t$. Conversely, the Always fillup to $S$ strategy (Periodic Review) involves placing a variable order quantity to reach the maximum level $S$, either when the inventory hits the reorder point $s$ or when a fixed cycle time $t$ is reached. All four scenarios implicitly account for Safety Stock and Lead Time by maintaining a minimum level to guard against demand or delivery delays.
