# Slide 31 of Lecture 5 contains information about Lorenz Curve: ABC-Analysis

The image, titled "ABC Analysis – Step 5-7," is the culmination of the ABC analysis process, building directly on the previous steps of calculating consumption value and ranking items to establish the final classification . This stage involves calculating and evaluating the cumulated percentage of both the item count (Consumption in % cumulated) and, most critically, the Value consumption in % cumulated. By ranking the articles from highest to lowest value (as established in the prior image's ranking step), the cumulative value column clearly reveals the concentration of wealth in the inventory. This data is then used to formally assign the Class (A, B, or C) to each group of items based on the Pareto Principle. For instance, the image highlights that a small percentage of items (A-items) are responsible for a large percentage of the total consumption value, justifying the management principle where the high-value A-items receive the most intensive inventory control and forecasting effort, while the numerous, low-value C-items are managed with simpler, less resource-intensive strategies.
