# Slide 15 of Lecture 5 contains information about The Economic Order Quantity

(EOQ) Model
The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model provides a way to determine the optimal order quantity by balancing different types of inventory costs. Inventory costs can be classified into purchase costs, which are the prices to be paid when buying items, order processing costs, which are the costs of procuring the inventory, and inventory holding costs, which include warehousing and related expenses. In the following notation, \(D\) represents the annual use of a particular item in number of items per annum, while \(S\) is the order-processing cost, expressed in \$/order. The parameter \(p\) denotes the price per item in \$/unit, and \(H\) stands for the holding cost per unit per year in \$/unit/year. The variable \(Q\) is the number of items ordered in one purchase order, measured in units, and \(T\) denotes the time period between purchase orders as a fraction of a year. In addition, \(SS\) is the safety stock in units, \(L\) is the lead time in fraction of a year and \(I\) is the current inventory on hand in units. Finally, TAC designates the total annual cost of the inventory system. 15
