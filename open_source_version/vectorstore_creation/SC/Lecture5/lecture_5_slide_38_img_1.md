The image, titled "Pitfalls in Managing Supply Chain Inventory (1/3)," outlines four major categories of problems related to information definition and supply chain management that severely undermine efficient inventory practices. The first pitfall, No supply chain metrics, is symptomatic of a single-company focus, leading to independent and disconnected individual sites where performance is crippled by incomplete metrics and a failure to track key measures across the chain. The second pitfall, Inadequate definition of customer service, creates internal dysfunction by lacking quantifiable service standards, such as measures for response times, lateness, or backorder profile, making it impossible to correctly determine Safety Stock and set realistic customer expectations. Third, Inaccurate delivery status data results from poor data quality in the physical flow of goods, manifested as delays in providing delivery information and overall inaccurate delivery information, which in turn causes lead time uncertainty and makes accurate Reorder Point calculation unreliable. Finally, Inefficient information systems represent the technological barrier to integration, characterized by inadequate linkage among databases at different sites, a proliferation of operating systems for the same function, and systemic delays and inaccuracies of data transfer. Collectively, these pitfalls demonstrate that effective inventory management depends fundamentally on establishing accurate, integrated information and shared, well-defined metrics across all supply chain partners.
