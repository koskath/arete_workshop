# Slide 35 of Lecture 5 contains information about Combined ABC-XYZ Analysis


This slide, titled "Combined ABC-XYZ Analysis," presents a comprehensive, nine-cell matrix that integrates two key inventory classification methods: ABC Analysis and XYZ Analysis . The purpose of this combined approach is to move beyond mere financial value (ABC) and incorporate the crucial dimension of demand predictability (XYZ) to create highly tailored inventory control strategies. The matrix is divided by ABC rows, which classify items based on their Value Share (A=High, B=Medium, C=Low), and XYZ columns, which classify items based on the Predictability of their demand (X=Easy/Stable, Y=Average/Fluctuating, Z=Difficult/Irregular). This structure yields nine distinct categories, allowing management to prioritize their resources: for instance, AX items (High Value, Stable Demand) require the most rigorous control and accurate forecasting to maximize profits and minimize costs, while CZ items (Low Value, Irregular Demand) are typically managed using simpler, less resource-intensive strategies like stocking a large buffer quantity, as the cost of forecasting them accurately would exceed the financial benefit. The overall analysis enables a company to strategically allocate resources for activities such as forecasting accuracy, safety stock levels, and physical control efforts across its entire inventory portfolio.
