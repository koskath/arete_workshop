# Slide 28 of Lecture 1 contains information about Using Logistics as a Basis for new Business Models – E.g.
# The image in slide 28 of lecture 1 showcases Levi's Personal Pair program as an example of how innovative logistics can enable entirely new business models - specifically, mass customization.
The process works in three steps:
1. "Measurement" in store - A customer visits a Levi's store and gets measured (the left image shows body scanning technology). Their exact measurements and fit preferences are captured digitally.
2. Direct link to factory - The store computer connects directly to the manufacturing facility. A state-of-the-art single-ply cutter cuts pieces specifically for that individual customer's jeans. They're sewn by a special team, washed, and marked with a unique barcode containing the customer's fit data.
3. Delivery - The customized jeans are delivered to the customer.
The key innovation is that logistics and information systems enable:

Mass customization instead of mass production
Individual products at near-mass-production prices
Direct connection from retail point to factory floor
Each pair of jeans is unique to the customer

This represents a fundamental shift in business model from "make to stock" (produce standard sizes and hope they sell) to "make to order" (produce exactly what each customer wants). Without sophisticated logistics and information flow management, this wouldn't be economically feasible.
It's a perfect example of how logistics isn't just about moving boxes - it can enable entirely new ways of doing business.
