# The image 1 in slide 37 of lecture 1 contains:
Supply chain level (global view) - the top layer: Shows a flat plane with red curved arrows flowing across it, representing the macro-level flow of materials, information, or products across the entire supply chain network. The arrows suggest movement and connections at a high-level, strategic perspective.
Company level (individual view) - the middle layer: Displays a plane with rectangular boxes connected by arrows. This represents a single company's internal structure and how it connects with external partners. The view is more detailed than the global level, focusing on organizational units and their direct relationships.
Process level - the bottom layer: Shows the most detailed plane with numerous small boxes and connecting arrows arranged in what appears to be workflow patterns. This represents the granular, operational level where actual business processes and activities occur.
The three layers are connected by dotted lines, indicating they are different levels of abstraction or perspectives of the same supply chain system. The diagram suggests that what appears as simple flows at the global level becomes increasingly complex as you zoom into company and process levels.
