# Slide 29 of Lecture 1 contains information about e.g. Innovative supply chain designs can serve as a basis for new business models.
For example, Levi‘s vision involves trying on and then sewing: measurement in store, transmission to production and direct distribution to consumers. Dell and also Amazon work with getting the order (and the money) before production and distribution into the channel (make-to-order). Benetton’s pullover is knitted in “white” and coloured later in the process. Zara, The Gap and H&M use fast, “one way” design in the fashion market. Altogether, these examples illustrate that how you “ship” it determines how you produce it.
