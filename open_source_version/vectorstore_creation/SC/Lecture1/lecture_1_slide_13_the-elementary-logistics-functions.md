# Slide 13 of Lecture 1 contains information about The elementary logistics functions:
Transportation, warehousing and transshipment are the elementary logistics functions. A key issue is: what questions could management have regarding these functions?

# The image in slide 13 of Lecture 1 is illustrating the three fundamental logistics functions that are the building blocks of supply chain management:

Transportation - Moving goods from point A to point B (shown through trucks, ships, planes, trains)
Warehousing - Storing and managing inventory (shown through warehouse racks, storage facilities, and the warehouse layout diagram with inbound/outbound areas)
Transshipment - The transfer and handling of goods between different modes of transport or storage locations (shown through conveyor systems, loading/unloading operations, and material handling equipment)

The cartoon on the left is particularly telling - it shows people drowning in paperwork and overwhelmed by inventory chaos, which represents the traditional problems of logistics management. The "Lean Warehousing" book visible in the image suggests the contrast between old, inefficient methods and modern, streamlined approaches.
The collage of images collectively demonstrates that these three functions involve multiple transportation modes (multimodal logistics), complex warehousing operations, and the critical connecting processes that move goods through the supply chain. The professor is essentially showing that while these may seem like simple concepts, they involve sophisticated operations across various modes and technologies - and when not managed well (as the cartoon suggests), they can create significant operational chaos.
