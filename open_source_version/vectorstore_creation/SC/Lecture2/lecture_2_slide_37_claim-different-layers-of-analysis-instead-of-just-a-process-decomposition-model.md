# Slide 37 of Lecture 2 contains information about Claim: Different Layers of analysis instead of just a Process-Decomposition Model

# The diagram in slide 37 of lecture 2 presents a multi-layered analytical framework for supply chain operations as an alternative to traditional process-decomposition models. 
The framework consists of four hierarchical levels organized along a Supply-Chain Operations Reference-model axis. Level 1, the Top Level Process Types, defines the scope and content for supply chain operations management, establishing the basis of competition and operational strategies. Level 2, the Configuration Level Process Categories, structures a company's supply chain according to 30 core process categories, enabling strategic configuration choices aligned with operational priorities. Level 3, the Process Element Level, decomposes processes to define a company's ability to compete in its chosen markets, incorporating process element information, inputs and outputs, process performance metrics, best practices, system capabilities, and operational improvements. Level 4, the Implementation Level, addresses specific supply-chain management practices at the most granular level, defining practices to achieve competitive advantage and adapt to changing business conditions. The right side of the diagram visualizes this hierarchy through progressively detailed triangular structures, with each level containing processes, process elements, tasks, and activities that provide balanced horizontal and vertical views. The framework is designed to be reconfigurable and capable of representing multiple configurations of similar processes while aggregating hierarchical process models. A "Not in Scope" section indicates boundaries beyond the framework's analytical reach.
