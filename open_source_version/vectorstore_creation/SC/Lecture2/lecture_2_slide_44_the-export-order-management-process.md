# Slide 44 of Lecture 2 contains information about The Export order management process
The export order management process can be viewed in terms of three interrelated flows. In the **order flow**, there is order negotiation (covering quantity, price, terms of delivery, etc.), order receipt (for example, a pro forma invoice) and order verification. In the **fulfilment flow**, there is customer verification (e.g. a letter of credit), arranging insurance (e.g. CIF or C&F), order filling or manufacture, and packaging and labelling. In the **payment flow**, there are pre-shipment inspections, documentation preparation (e.g. certificate of origin, bill of lading, airway bill, etc.) and shipment.
