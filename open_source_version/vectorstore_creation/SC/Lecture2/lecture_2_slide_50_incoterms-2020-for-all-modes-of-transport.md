# Slide 50 of Lecture 2 contains information about Incoterms 2020 for all modes of transport
# The image in slide 50 of lecture 2 is a diagram showing various trade terms associated with the seller and buyer responsibilities for risks and costs along a supply chain:
The diagram features sections that include icons and horizontal bars delineating these responsibilities.

At the top, a header contains icons representing different stages of the supply chain from left to right: a factory indicating "Seller," a truck, a warehouse labeled "Cargo terminal," a customs building labeled "Customs," a series of loading cranes over ships labeled "Cargo terminal," and a cityscape labeled "Buyer." Vertical lines separate these sections.

The main part of the diagram consists of rows labeled with different trade terms (EXW, FCA (a), FCA (b), CPT, CIP, DAP, DPU, DDP) on the right side. Each row corresponds to:
1. **EXW**: Two dark blue horizontal bars extend across all sections from "Seller" to "Buyer."
2. **FCA (a)**: A light green bar extends from "Seller" to "Cargo terminal," a dark blue bar continues from "Cargo terminal" across all sections to "Buyer."
3. **FCA (b)**: A light green bar goes from "Seller" to the middle of the "Customs" section, a dark blue bar continues to "Buyer."
4. **CPT**: A light green bar starts at "Seller" and ends at "Cargo terminal" before the ships, a dark blue bar extends from there to "Buyer."
5. **CIP**: Light green starts at "Seller" and ends at "Customs," with an emphasis on additional "Insurance," a dark blue bar from "Customs" to "Buyer."
6. **DAP**: Light green covers all sections up to the final "Customs" section, where it switches to dark blue until reaching "Buyer."
7. **DPU**: Light green covers complete sections up to "Cargo terminal," then dark blue from there to the "Buyer."
8. **DDP**: Entirely light green covering all sections from "Seller" to "Buyer."

Each label is followed by descriptive phrases indicating the nature of the trade term:
- EXW: "EX Works (...named place)"
- FCA (a): "Free CArrier (...named place = seller’s premises)"
- FCA (b): "Free CArrier (...named other place ≠ seller’s premises)"
- CPT: "Carriage Paid To (...named place of destination)"
- CIP: "Carriage and Insurance Paid To (...named place of destination)"
- DAP: "Delivered At Place (...named place of destination)"
- DPU: "Delivered at Place Unloaded (...named place of destination)"
- DDP: "Delivered Duties Paid (...named place of destination)"

On the left, there are icons representing various modes of transport: an airplane, a cargo ship, a truck, and a train carrying a container.

Overall, the diagram provides a visual representation of the shift in responsibility for risks and costs between the seller and the buyer across different stages of transportation depending on the trade terms.
