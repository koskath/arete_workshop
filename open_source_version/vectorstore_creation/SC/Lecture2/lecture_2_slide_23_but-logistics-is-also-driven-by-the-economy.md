# Slide 23 of Lecture 2 contains information about But Logistics is also driven by the economy
# The image 1 in slide 23 of lecture 2 shows the frontal view of a large cargo ship on the ocean:
The ship's hull is predominantly light blue with a red section at the top, just below the deck. A symbol resembling an emblem with wings is visible centered on the hull below the deck area. The name of the ship appears on both sides of the hull in small letters, though it's difficult to discern from this angle.

Stacked on the deck are multiple rows of rectangular cargo containers in various colors, including shades of grey, blue, and some red. The superstructure of the ship, situated above the containers, includes the bridge which is cream-colored. Two yellow structures that resemble cranes or derricks extend upwards from the front of the superstructure, converging at the base and forming an inverted "V" shape.

The ship is resting on a water surface with slight waves visible. The sky is overcast, giving the background a grey hue.

# The image 2 in slide 23 is a combination graph comprising a bar chart and a line graph titled "Total world container handling." It includes the following elements:

- **X-axis (Horizontal):** 
  - Labeled with years from left to right: 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 00, 02, 04, 06, 08, and 10.

- **Left Y-axis (Vertical):** 
  - Measures "Container handling, m TEU" with values from 0 to 600, marked at intervals of 100 (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600).

- **Right Y-axis (Vertical):** 
  - Measures "% yoy" with values from 0 to 18, marked at intervals of 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18).

- **Bar Chart (Blue Bars):** 
  - Represents "Container handling, m TEU."
  - Each bar corresponds to a specific year, starting at 90 and ending at 10.
  - The bars increase in height over time, beginning around 100 m TEU in 90 and peaking near 550 m TEU in 08, then slightly decreasing by 10.

- **Line Graph (Black Line):** 
  - Represents "% yoy."
  - The line fluctuates through the years, showing several peaks and troughs:
    - It begins around 6 in 90.
    - Peaks to about 9 around 94, then declines.
    - Another peak near 8 in 00, then down to below 0 in 02.
    - A notable sharp peak just above 15 in 07.
    - A drastic dip to slightly below -3 in 09, rebounding above 12 in 10.

- **Background Shading:**
  - A shaded vertical band appears from 08 to 10, highlighting this period.

- **Legend (Bottom Left):** 
  - Blue square with "Container handling, m TEU (left)."
  - Gray line with "% yoy (right)."

- **Sources (Bottom Center):** 
  - Text indicates "Sources: Drewry, DB Research."

The graph illustrates trends in total world container handling and percentage year-over-year changes from 1990 to 2010.
