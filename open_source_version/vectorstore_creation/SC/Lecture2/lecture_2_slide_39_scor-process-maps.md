# Slide 39 of Lecture 2 contains information about SCOR Process Maps
The second step in applying SCOR is to create the SCOR process maps. This involves placing planning process categories and using dashed lines to show links with execution processes, thereby visualising how planning and execution interact across the supply chain.

# The image in slide 38 of lecture 2  is a detailed supply chain diagram structured into three main columns, each divided by vertical dashed lines:
The columns are labeled at the bottom as "Supplier's Supplier," "Suppliers," "ACME," "Customers," and "Customer's Customers."

**First Section: Semiconductor Manufacturer and Distributor**

- The first column labeled "Semiconductor Manufacturer" features a rectangle labeled "D2" on the far left.
- A rightward arrow leads from "D2" to a rectangle labeled "S1" in the "Semiconductor Distributor" column.
- Below this area, two labels indicate the flow direction: "Supplier's Supplier" on the far left and "Suppliers" between the dashed lines.

**Central Section: ACME Laptop Production**

- The next column, labeled "Suppliers," follows the previous flow with rectangles "D2" (two of them) leading into two "S1" rectangles.
- The main central column labeled "ACME Laptop Production (San Jose)" has multiple interconnected components:
  - A rectangle labeled "M1" is central, with flow arrows coming from "S1" and leading to "D1."
  - The topmost flow diagram includes interconnected circles labeled "P1," "P2," "P3," and "P4," representing processes facilitated by directed arrows between them.
  - Arrows diverge to all "P" labels with additional connections flowing back and forth among them, showing complex internal interactions.

**Right Section: Laptop Distributor and Retailer**

- The right column "Customers" has "S1" rectangles leading to "D1," further flowing into another "S1" and "D1" in the "Laptop Retailer" column.
- Circular icons for "P1" and "P2" continue above, linked similarly through arrows.

All rectangles use either a light green or light blue color scheme, while circles (P1–P4) are blue. Each section is enclosed with dashed lines, properly segmenting the various stages in this supply chain. Indicators at the bottom describe the flow of goods or processes: "ACME" between "Suppliers" and "Customers," and similarly "Customers" leading towards "Customer's Customers." Arrows throughout indicate the direction of flow among entities.
