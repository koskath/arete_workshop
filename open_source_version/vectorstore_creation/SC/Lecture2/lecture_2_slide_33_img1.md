# Slide 33 of Lecture 2 contains information about The diagram in slide 33 of lecture 2 depicts a hierarchical system architecture with multiple ranked levels:
 At the outermost layer, the Environment encompasses all internal components. Within this, the Super System (Rank = +1) contains a Function element that operates at the highest organizational level. The core System (Rank = 0) serves as the primary operational layer, housing multiple Sub-Systems (Rank = -1) represented as interconnected boxes. A red flow line traces the process path through these sub-systems, illustrating the operational sequence and interdependencies. Input enters the system from the left side, flows through the various sub-system components in a cyclical pattern, and produces Output on the right side. This structure demonstrates a nested systems approach where each hierarchical level operates at different ranks, with information and processes flowing both vertically through the ranks and horizontally through the sub-system components.
