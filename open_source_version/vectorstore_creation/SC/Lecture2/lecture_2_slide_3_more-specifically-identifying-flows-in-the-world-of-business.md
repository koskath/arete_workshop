# Slide 3 of Lecture 2 contains information about ... more specifically: identifying „flows“ in the world of business
# The diagram in slide 3 of lecture 2 illustrates a fundamental concept in supply chain management: the difference between organizational structure and actual flows in a business.

The Black Boxes (Hierarchy): These represent the formal organizational structure - the traditional "org chart" showing reporting relationships and departments. It's neat, hierarchical, and tree-like
The Blue Arrows (Flows): These show the actual flows in the business - this could be: Material/product flows, Information flows, Financial flows, Decision-making processes
The Key Point: The diagram demonstrates that real business flows don't follow the organizational hierarchy. While companies have neat organizational charts, the actual way work gets done, information moves, and products flow is much more complex and cross-functional.
The "Customer" Box at the Bottom: This emphasizes that all these flows ultimately serve the customer - a core principle in supply chain management.
