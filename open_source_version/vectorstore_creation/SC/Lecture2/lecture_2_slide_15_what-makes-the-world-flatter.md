# Slide 15 of Lecture 2 contains information about What makes the world flatter?
According to Friedman, several factors have contributed to making the world flatter. These include: (1) 11/9/89, the fall of the Berlin Wall; (2) 8/9/95, the birth of the internet (when Netscape went public); (3) workflow software that coordinates tasks; (4) open-sourcing through self-organising collaborative communities that produced Linux and Wikipedia; (5) outsourcing, for example moving software coding to India, where demand for coding far in excess of US capacity created the necessity; (6) offshoring, the movement of manufacturing jobs to low-wage developing countries; (7) supply-chaining, exemplified by Wal-Mart’s supply chain management practices; (8) “insourcing”, such as UPS not only picking up your broken Toshiba laptop but also repairing it, allowing small companies to act large because the fixed-cost logistics infrastructure is supplied by a third party; (9) “in-forming”, through Google and internet searches; and (10) the “steroids”: digital, mobile, personal and virtual communications, including videoconferences.
