# Slide 19 of Lecture 2 contains information about Global Resources and Dynamics – Footloose Industries and the “Goose Flight”

# The diagram in slide 19 illustrates the "Flying Geese" pattern of industrial development, specifically showing Japan's shifting competitive advantages across different industries over time:
The vertical axis represents "Competitive Edge" while the horizontal axis represents "time." Five different industries are shown as arc-shaped curves that rise and fall sequentially across the timeline.
Starting from the left, Textiles (shown in red) represents Japan's earliest competitive advantage, with the arc rising and then declining. Next comes Chemicals (in light blue), which overlaps slightly with textiles but peaks later. Iron/Steel (in dark blue) follows, showing Japan's competitive edge in heavy industry during a subsequent period.
Autos appears as a very faint or gray arc in the middle-right portion of the timeline. Finally, Electronics (in dark blue) appears on the far right, representing Japan's most recent competitive advantage.
The pattern resembles geese flying in formation, with each industry rising to a peak of competitive advantage and then declining as the next industry takes over. This visualization demonstrates how Japan's economy evolved over time, moving from labor-intensive industries like textiles toward increasingly sophisticated, technology-intensive industries like electronics. Each arc represents a phase where Japan held a significant competitive edge in that particular industry.
