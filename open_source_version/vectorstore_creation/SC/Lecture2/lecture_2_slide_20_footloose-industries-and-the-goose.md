# Slide 20 of Lecture 2 contains information about … – Footloose Industries and the “Goose Flight”

# The diagram in slide 20 of lecture 2 applies the Flying Geese model to garment production across Asian countries and regions over time.
The vertical axis shows "Competitive Edge" and the horizontal axis represents "time." The diagram displays a sequence of arc-shaped curves representing different countries' or regions' competitive advantages in garment manufacturing.
Starting from the left, Japan (in red) shows the first arc, indicating it was the initial leader in garment production. Taiwan (in light blue) follows with an overlapping arc that peaks after Japan's begins to decline. ASEAN countries (in dark blue) come next with their competitive advantage rising as Taiwan's wanes.
China (shown in gray or very light coloring) appears in the middle-right section of the timeline. Following China, the diagram shows Vietnam, Indien (India), Kasachstan and ellipsis (...) indicating additional countries continuing the pattern into the future.
The red text at the top asks "Who produces garments in Asia?" The sequential pattern illustrates how garment manufacturing has migrated from more developed to less developed economies across Asia over time, with each country or region gaining competitive advantage as labor costs and development levels shift, then eventually losing that advantage to the next lower-cost location in the sequence.
