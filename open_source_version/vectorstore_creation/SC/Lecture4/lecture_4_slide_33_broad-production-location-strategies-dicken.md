# Slide 33 of Lecture 4 contains information about Broad production location strategies Dicken

# The image in slide 33 of lecture 4 is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different configuration strategy: "Centralized Production," "Regional Production," "Regional Specialization," and "Vertical Integration." Each quadrant contains four colored squares labeled with different countries: "Country A," "Country B," "Country C," and "Country D." The relationships and interactions among these countries are depicted through arrows of varying directions and thickness.

1. **Centralized Production (Top Left Quadrant)**:
   - Background color: Blue.
   - Country A (Top left): Contains four small, dark blue squares arranged in a 2x2 grid. Three arrows emerge:
     - A thick arrow pointing right towards an empty orange square labeled "Country B."
     - A thick arrow pointing diagonally downwards to the right towards an empty yellow square labeled "Country D."
     - A thick arrow pointing downwards towards an empty green square labeled "Country C."

2. **Regional Production (Top Right Quadrant)**:
   - Background color: Blue.
   - Each country contains a set of small colored squares:
     - Country A (Top left): Four small dark blue squares arranged in a grid.
     - Country B (Top right): One small orange square.
     - Country C (Bottom left): Four small green squares arranged in a grid.
     - Country D (Bottom right): Four small yellow squares arranged in a grid.
   - Each country's squares have thin arrows pointing outward in all four cardinal directions: up, down, left, and right.

3. **Regional Specialization (Bottom Left Quadrant)**:
   - Background color: Blue.
   - Each country contains one large square with a distinct color:
     - Country A (Top left): Dark blue.
     - Country B (Top right): Orange.
     - Country C (Bottom left): Green.
     - Country D (Bottom right): Yellow.
   - There are numerous thick black arrows showing bidirectional interactions among all countries, indicating complex inter-country relationships and exchanges.

4. **Vertical Integration (Bottom Right Quadrant)**:
   - Background color: Blue.
   - Each country contains one large square:
     - Country A (Top left): Dark blue.
     - Country B (Top right): Orange.
     - Country C (Bottom left): Green.
     - Country D (Bottom right): Yellow.
   - Country A has a thin black arrow pointing right towards Country B, and a similar arrow pointing downward towards Country C.
   - Country C has a thin black arrow pointing up towards Country A, indicating a feedback link.

Overall, the quadrants are separated by thick blue borders with vertical labels on each side: "Centralized Production" on the left and "Regional Production" on the right above, and "Regional Specialization" on the left and "Vertical Integration" on the right below.
