# Slide 14 of Lecture 4 contains information about History continued: But also the other side of “Taylorism”
needs to be acknowledged, as it treats human work primarily as a production factor. In this approach, workload and bonus systems are central: bringing the predefined daily workload results in premium pay. The new systems are fixed in operating instructions and record cards administered by a bureau for work planning, and responsibility for work design is placed on foremen or bosses rather than on workers themselves. However, there were significant “worker reactions”. For example, “Congress investigated complaints by government workers and the use of stopwatches was banned by law in government shops”, and “workers had gone on strike at the Watertown Arsenal when specialists came in with stopwatches”. Although “Taylor blamed this on union agitators”, it was in fact directed at Taylorism itself, because “skilled workers did not want to lose control of their work”. Moreover, “workers weren't convinced by Taylor's belief that rationalizing management so that it was fair according to scientific principles would eliminate the conflict between workers and management”.
