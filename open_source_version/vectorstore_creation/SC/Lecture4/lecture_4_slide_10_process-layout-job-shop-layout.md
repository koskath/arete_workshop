# Slide 10 of Lecture 4 contains information about Process Layout – Job shop layout

# The diagram in slide 10 of lecture 4 illustrates a job shop process layout for manufacturing operations:
The facility is organized into distinct functional departments positioned across the floor space. The Lathe Department occupies the left side, containing ten workstations arranged in a vertical configuration. Adjacent to this is the Milling Department in the upper center area, which houses four milling machines organized in two rows. The Drilling Department is positioned in the upper right section, featuring eight drilling stations arranged in two rows of four units each.
The middle section contains the Grinding Department with six grinding machines arranged in two rows, while the Painting Department is located on the right side with two painting stations. The lower right area is designated for Assembly operations with three assembly workstations. The Receiving and Shipping function is positioned in the lower center portion of the layout.
Red arrows throughout the diagram trace multiple material flow paths, demonstrating the non-linear routing of work-in-process items as they move between various departments. These flow lines illustrate the characteristic back-and-forth movement pattern typical of job shop operations, where products follow customized routes based on their specific processing requirements. The arrows show complex interconnections between departments, with materials flowing from lathes to milling operations, then to drilling, grinding, painting, and finally to assembly, with various intermediate routing patterns between these stages.
