# The image in slide 8 of lecture 4 depicts an antique automobile, specifically an early model car with a classic design often associated with the early 20th century:
The car has a distinctive open-top construction with four large black spoked wheels. The front wheels are turned slightly to the left. The front of the car features two prominent brass headlights on either side of the vehicle. The front grille is rectangular with a brass border and a black panel with the word "Ford" in script.
