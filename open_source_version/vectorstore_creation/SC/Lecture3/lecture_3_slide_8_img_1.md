# The image 1 in slide 8 of lecture 3 contains:
The image depicts a cartoon penguin standing facing forward. The penguin has a rounded body and is predominantly black and white. The head is black with two circular white areas on the face for the eyes, each containing a small black dot for pupils. The beak is orange and roughly triangular. Two small tufts of black feathers stick up at the top of the head.

The penguin is wearing a white t-shirt emblazoned with the words "I'm the BOSS" in bold, blue uppercase letters. The shirt fits snugly around the penguin's body, extending to the flippers, which are black and positioned along the sides of the torso.

The lower part of the penguin's body is white, transitioning into yellow feet with rounded toes visible at the base. A soft gray shadow is cast beneath the penguin, suggesting a light source from above.

In the bottom right corner, there is a small, black signature that reads "©  goolie."
