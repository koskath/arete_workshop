The image features three animated hyenas positioned closely together. 

- The hyena on the left has a wide grin showing its teeth, with its right eye visibly wider than the left. Both eyes have yellow irises with small black pupils. The ears are dark brown and upright. The fur is mostly grey with dark spots visible on its head.

- The central hyena has a slightly mischievous smile with closed lips, showing none of its teeth. Its eyes are partially closed, with yellow irises and black pupils. The fur is grey with some darker shading around the eyes, and there are several tufts of black fur on top of its head. Dark brown ears are visible on either side.

- The hyena on the right is sticking out its tongue towards the left, with a wide open grin revealing its teeth and gums. Both eyes are wide open, with yellow irises and black pupils. The fur is grey with darker areas around the eyes, similar to the central hyena. Its ears are dark brown, and its tongue is pink.

The background features abstract, swirling blue shapes with darker shades at the top and bottom. The overall palette is composed of shades of grey, blue, brown, and touches of pink.
