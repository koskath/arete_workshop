# The image 2 in slide 22 of lecture 3 contains:
The image is a line graph titled "DEMAND OF IBM-PC." It depicts demand information on a set of axes. The x-axis is labeled "Time after market introduction" with a sub-label "Weeks," and it ranges from 0 to 25, with tick marks at intervals of 1 week. The y-axis is labeled "Demand" with a sub-label "Units," ranging from 0 to 350 with tick marks at intervals of 50 units.

Two lines are plotted on the graph. 

1. A jagged, fluctuating black line with sharp peaks and troughs represents the actual demand. It starts at the origin and fluctuates frequently, showing high variability. Some noticeable high peaks occur near weeks 5, 9, and 15, and significant low troughs appear around weeks 3 and 20.

2. A smoother, curved line indicates a trend or moving average. It begins slightly above the origin, rises to reach a maximum between weeks 10 and 15, then declines gradually towards week 25.

The graph includes annotations with gridlines extending horizontally from the y-axis and vertically from the x-axis. There are no data points explicitly marked on the lines.
