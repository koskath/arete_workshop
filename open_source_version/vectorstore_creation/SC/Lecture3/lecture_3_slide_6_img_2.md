# The image 2 in slide 6 of lecture 3 contains:
The image depicts an hourglass standing upright against a background of a cloudy sky. The frame of the hourglass is a deep blue, with bulbous, ornamental columns connecting the top and bottom sections. Inside the hourglass, instead of sand, there are multiple interlocking gears of varying sizes, ranging in shades from yellow to gold. The gears are intricately positioned, some larger and others smaller, with teeth that mesh together as if suggesting mechanical movement. The top half of the hourglass has thick clouds encroaching on its side, partially obscuring the edges. At the bottom right of the image, there are two small silhouetted figures standing on a flat surface, looking up at the hourglass. Their small size compared to the hourglass emphasizes the grandeur of the structure. The sky behind is a soft gradient of blues and whites, enhancing the hourglass's prominent appearance in the foreground.
