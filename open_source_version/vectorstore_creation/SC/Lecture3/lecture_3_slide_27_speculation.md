# Slide 27 of Lecture 3 contains information about Speculation

The image is a graph with a title at the top left labeled "Orders, Demand, Production CPUs". The y-axis is labeled "Units" and is divided into "Real Demand" and "Production." The x-axis represents time, marked by two labels: "Market Introduction" and "End of life cycle," each with a black triangular symbol underneath.

There are three curved lines on the graph:

1. A line labeled "Orders" that starts high on the left, increases even further before decreasing towards the right.
2. A line labeled "Real Demand" that starts moderately high on the left, increases to form a peak near the middle, and then gradually decreases toward the right.
3. A line labeled "Production" that begins at zero on the left, steadily increases past the "Market Introduction" point, intersects the "Real Demand" line, forms a peak, and then declines before intersecting the "Orders" line.

Two shaded areas are marked on the graph:

1. "Shortage" is indicated between the "Orders" and "Production" lines before their first intersection.
2. "Oversupply" is indicated between the "Production" and "Real Demand" lines after their intersection.

In the top-right corner, there is a box labeled "Further Examples" listing the following items:

- Mercedes SLK
- Tamagotchis
- Beany Babies
- Mobile phone
- ...
