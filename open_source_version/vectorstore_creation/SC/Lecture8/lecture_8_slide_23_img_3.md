# The image 3 in slide 23 of lecture 8 contains:

There are three overlapping ovals positioned horizontally:

1. The leftmost oval contains the word "Supplier."
2. The middle oval is labeled "Service provider."
3. The rightmost oval, overlapping with the middle one, is labeled "Consumer."

In the overlap between the "Service provider" and "Consumer" ovals, there is a black dot. A line extends from the black dot diagonally downward and to the right, pointing to the annotation "Service provision," written in italicized text.

Above the three ovals, there is a horizontal, double-headed arrow labeled "Knowledge and Resources." The arrow stretches from left to right, running parallel to the line of ovals.
