# Slide 17 of Lecture 12 contains information about MRP 50-60ies - MRP I, 60ies- 80ies MRP II, from the 80ies
# The image in slide 17 of lecture 12 is a flowchart diagram related to MRP (Material Requirement Planning) and MRP II (Manufacturing Resources Planning). It consists of several boxes, arrows, and text annotations.

1. **Background and Overall Structure**:
   - The background is light yellow with a purple border, with text blocks arranged horizontally and vertically.
   - There is a blue rectangular border towards the center, encapsulating some of the inner blocks.

2. **Top Level**:
   - Two labeled sections in black text on gray boxes: 
     - "MRP II Management Resources Planning" at the top right.
     - "MRP I Manufacturing Resources Planning" at the top left.

3. **Main Flowchart**:
   - Vertical Stack, top to bottom:
     - "Vertriebsplanung" (Sales Planning) in a wide beige box.
     - "Entwicklungsplanung" (Development Planning) in a gray box slightly narrower than the previous.
     - "Produktionsprogramm" (Production Program) in a white box.
     - An orange-outlined box labeled "Bruttobedarfserrechnung (Stücklistenauflösung)" (Gross Requirements Calculation (BOM Explosion)), with a smaller white label over it reading "Nettobedarfserrechnung" (Net Requirements Calculation).
     - Black arrows and lines indicating flow between boxes.

4. **Middle Row – Center Section**:
   - Three gray and white gradient striped rectangular boxes:
     - Left: "Stückliste" (BOM), "Lagerbestände" (Inventory), "Vorlaufzeiten" (Lead Times) with short arrows pointing right.
     - Center: "Bedarfsoptimierung" (Demand Optimization) with lines pointing both left to the left box and right.
     - Right: "Mengenplanung" (Quantity Planning), marked as part of "MRP" with arrows pointing right.

5. **Middle Row – Lower Section**:
   - Two gradient rectangular boxes at the bottom along with others on the left and center.
     - Left: "Losgrößen- berechnungsverfahren" (Lot Size Calculation Methods) with a down arrow.
     - Center: "Bildung von Fertigungs- und Montagelosen" (Formation of Production and Assembly Lots) with arrows pointing right.
     - Right: "Termin- planung" (Scheduling).

6. **Bottom Level**:
   - Two beige boxes labeled vertically:
     - "Kapazitätsbedarfsplanung" (Capacity Requirement Planning).
     - "Werkstattsteuerung" (Shop Floor Control).

7. **Miscellaneous**:
   - Arrows and connecting lines show process flows between different boxes.
   - Boxes are primarily outlined in black with varying widths and border styles to distinguish sections.
   - The structure overall creates a clear flowchart intended to show relationships and processes within MRP systems.
