## Description of the figure in slide 33 of lecture 12

The figure again shows two companies: **Supplier** and **Customer**, each with the same internal functions:  
- Finance  
- Sales  
- Production  
- … (other processes)

Arrows connect multiple functions **in both directions**, indicating **m:n relationships**—many-to-many connections across business units rather than the simpler 1:1 or 1:n links from earlier phases.  
This means any unit in one company can connect dynamically to multiple units in the other, reflecting higher degrees of integration and flexibility.

Below the companies is a horizontal layer labeled **“Standards”**, containing elements such as:
- **Trust**  
- **Billing**  
- **Transport**  
- **……**  

These represent shared infrastructure services and standardized protocols that support seamless cross-company collaboration.

The visual communicates the move toward a **web-service-based, standardized information infrastructure**, enabling efficient, large-scale networking among many business units across multiple organizations.
