# Slide 51 of Lecture 12 contains information about Semi-active electronic Tags with Sensing Functions
Semi-active electronic tags with sensing functions, in the classical form of a smart card, have been on the market for quite a few years. They are used for monitoring temperature in logistical processes, for example for pharmaceutical products, flowers and food. These tags typically have very short reading ranges (some tens of centimetres) but larger data storage areas (8 kBit and more), and costs per tag are estimated to be a few euros. Their functions include identification, data storage and the sensing of different environmental parameters.
