# Slide 14 of Lecture 12 contains information about Next: Scheduling and order release

# The image 1 in slide 14 of lecture 2 contains a Vertical Process Flow: 

### Stage 1: Master Production Schedule (Top)
- Gray box at the top of the hierarchy
- Initiates the planning process

### Stage 2: Material Requirement (Middle)
- Gray layered box showing multiple planning iterations
- 3D stacked effect indicates multiple material requirement calculations
- Receives input from Master production schedule

### Stage 3: Scheduling Order Release (Bottom)
- Red box emphasizing execution phase
- Final stage in the planning sequence
- Receives input from Material requirement planning

## Flow Direction
The process flows vertically from top to bottom:
1. **Master production schedule** → 
2. **Material requirement** → 
3. **Scheduling Order release**

## Side Labels
Left vertical axis shows two chain management categories:
- **Güntner Produkt – GA – Genomsnittligt Cha** (upper section)
- **Y-Genomsnittligt Cha** (lower section)

These labels indicate different product chain management levels or categories that align with the planning stages.


# The image 2 in slide 14 contains tables with data organized in six sub-sections, each representing a different component or assembly.
Each section outlines the following elements: component or assembly name, lead time, the tables with headers for gross requirements, scheduled receipts, projected available balance, and planned order releases.
