# Slide 52 of Lecture 12 contains information about Here is what the Table in slide 52 of lecture 12 contains (Line by Line):

---

### **How is the information coded?**
- Hand or machine written  
- Machine readable label with object ID  
- One or two dimensional barcode label of object ID  
- Passive transponder, RFID tag, electronic label  
- Active transponder, sensor tags  

---

### **How is information read at I-Point?**
- By human eyes  
- Optical reading devices; character recognition (OCR)  
- Optical by mobile or stationary barcode scanner  
- Via radio waves in reading area of antennas (poles, gates)  
- Reading and/or writing via radio waves, antennas …  

---

### **Where is the status information stored?**
- Maybe on label; more likely in central database  
- Data record on central server  
- Data record on central server  
- Data record on central server  
- Status updated directly at physical object (resp. tag)  

---

### **Where/how is the required control activity triggered?**
- —  
- Centralized matching of “as is” and “to be”; triggering  
- Centralized matching of “as is” and “to be”; triggering  
- Centralized matching of “as is” and “to be”; triggering  
- De-centralized and permanent possible; autonomous alarms thinkable  

---

### **Basic advantages**
- No additional costs  
- No or limited costs for the labels  
- Low costs for labels; automatization  
- Higher automation (no visual contact required; bulk-reading / multi-tagging)  
- Information available at the object; additional options by sensor technology  

---

### **Basic disadvantages / dangers**
- Reading errors, typos, lack of motivations  
- Reading errors more likely; dirty, hidden labels  
- Single reading of barcode; dirty, hidden labels  
- Label costs; maybe jamming by radiation, metal, interference  
- Reading of status information requires reading devices; power supply and higher cost for the tags
