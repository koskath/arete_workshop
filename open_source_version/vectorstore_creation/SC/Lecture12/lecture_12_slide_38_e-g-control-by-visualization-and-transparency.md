# Slide 38 of Lecture 12 contains information about e.g. Control by visualization and Transparency

# Logic Behind the Pictures in slide 38 of lecture 12: 

The images illustrate **Lean management principles**, specifically how **visual controls** make workplace problems immediately visible so they can be quickly addressed. The goal is to create a work environment where abnormalities, delays, and inefficiencies cannot hide.

## Left Image: The Chaotic, Non-Transparent Workplace

The left illustration shows a factory full of:
- Hidden **breakdowns**
- **Wastes**
- **Abnormal conditions**
- **Parts shortages**
- **Delivery delays**
- Workers asking, *“How can I improve?”* despite having no clear overview

Key idea:  
**When information is not visible, problems stay buried.**  
Operators and supervisors cannot easily detect what is happening, leading to:
- Slow reaction times  
- Accumulation of waste  
- Confusion and frustration  
- Systemic inefficiency  

This picture represents a traditional, poorly visualized workplace where issues are hard to observe.

## Right Image: The Easy-to-Observe Workplace (Andon System)

The right illustration shows a streamlined, transparent production line equipped with **Andon**, a visual signaling system used in Lean and Toyota Production Systems.

Key visual mechanisms:
- **Andon board (circled in blue):** Shows the status of each station (1–8)  
  - A light or number highlights when a station faces a problem  
  - Supervisors and operators can instantly see where help is needed  
- **Stop button (circled in red):** Allows any operator to alert the line supervisor  
  - Workers can stop the line if something goes wrong  
  - Encourages quality at the source  
- **Supervisor observing abnormalities:** Transparency enables proactive management

The workplace becomes:
- **Self-explanatory**
- **Self-regulating**
- **Self-improving**

The logic:  
**Visualization turns hidden problems into visible ones, enabling rapid response and continuous improvement.**  
Instead of uncertainty, everyone clearly sees what is happening in real-time.

## Combined Message

Together, the images contrast:
- A **cluttered, opaque** production environment (left)  
vs.  
- A **transparent, easily observable** Lean workplace (right)

The core logic is that **visual transparency = operational control**.  
When issues are visible, the organization:
- Reacts faster  
- Reduces waste  
- Improves quality  
- Empowers workers  
- Strengthens continuous improvement  

This is the essence of Lean visual management.
