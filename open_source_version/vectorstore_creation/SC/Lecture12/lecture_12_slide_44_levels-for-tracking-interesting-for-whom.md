# Slide 44 of Lecture 12 contains information about Levels for Tracking – Interesting for whom

# The image in slide 44 of lecture 12 features a simplified illustration of a cargo ship with stacked containers:
The ship is depicted in a dark gray silhouette profile on the left, facing right. On the ship, rectangular containers are stacked in rows and columns with four containers in height and extending towards the right from the middle of the ship. Each container is outlined in white with vertical lines suggesting doors.

Above the containers are three circular icons with numbers inside, each on top of green radio wave signals:

1. **Icon "1"** - Located towards the left above the ship's bridge. It is a green circle with the number "1" in white inside. There is a set of green semi-circular arcs emanating from this point, suggesting a wireless signal.

2. **Icon "2"** - Positioned centrally above the containers. It is a green circle with the number "2" in white inside. Green arcs radiate outward, indicating another wireless signal.

3. **Icon "3"** - Placed near the right, above the tallest stack of containers. It is also a green circle with the number "3" in white inside, with similar green arcs projecting outward.

Each icon has a corresponding number situated vertically on the right, "1," "2," and "3," inside green circles, aligned vertically.

Additionally, there are green diagonal lines connecting certain containers on the ship, creating an interlinked pattern that suggests connectivity or network paths between the containers.

The background is plain white, providing contrast to the dark gray of the ship and the green elements.
