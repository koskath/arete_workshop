# Slide 2 of Lecture 12 contains information about Digitization vs. Digitalization
Digitization refers to converting analogue data into digital form for further processing by electronic means. Digitalization, by contrast, is about the application of digital technologies by organisations, industries or societies, for example through cargo control systems, big data, paperless trade, the Internet of Things, blockchains, e‑customs systems, “Uberization”, e‑payment systems, digital transformation and electronic documents such as eB/L, eAWB and eCMR. Digitalization thus involves the automation of operations or administrative processes, the connection of different services and the development of new business models, up to and including the disruptive transformation of supply chains. It builds on digitization as the underlying condition.
