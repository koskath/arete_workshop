# Slide 60 of Lecture 12 contains information about and changes into a „ product system“ or rather a „system of systems“ in another evolutionary step and an example from the farming industry

# The image 1 in slide 60 of lecture 12 consists of two main sections labeled "4. Product system" and "5. System of systems," both set against a light gray background.

**Left Side (Product system):**

- **Title:** "4. Product system" is located at the top left corner in black text. The section is highlighted with a light gray rectangle.
- **Farm Equipment System:**
  - A large circle labeled "FARM EQUIPMENT SYSTEM" in the center.
  - Three lines extend outwards from the circle with labels at their ends:
    - "TRACTORS" is at the left, connected to an icon of a tractor with three curved lines above it indicating wireless communication.
    - "PLANTERS" is at the top.
    - "TILLERS" is at the bottom.
  - An arrow labeled "COMBINE HARVESTERS" points towards the right, connecting to the next section.

**Right Side (System of systems):**

- **Title:** "5. System of systems" is located at the top right corner in black text. This section is enclosed in another light gray rectangle.
- **Central Structure:**
  - Five interconnected circles arranged around a central smaller circle.
  - **Center Circle:** Labeled "FARM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM."
  - **Upper Circle:** Labeled "WEATHER DATA SYSTEM." Four lines extend from it, leading to:
    - "WEATHER MAPS" on the upper left.
    - "WEATHER FORECASTS" on the upper right.
    - "RAIN, HUMIDITY, TEMPERATURE SENSORS" on the left.
    - "WEATHER DATA APPLICATION" on the right.
  - **Left Circle:** "FARM EQUIPMENT SYSTEM," connected to a tractor icon similar to the one on the left side.
  - **Right Circle:** "SEED OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM," with three lines leading to:
    - "FARM PERFORMANCE DATABASE" on the upper right.
    - "SEED DATABASE" on the right.
    - "SEED OPTIMIZATION APPLICATION" on the lower right.
  - **Lower Circle:** "IRRIGATION SYSTEM," with two lines:
    - "FIELD SENSORS" on the left.
    - "IRRIGATION APPLICATION" on the right.
  - An additional label, "IRRIGATION NODES," is below the lower circle.
  
The design involves multiple interconnected circles and arrows indicating the flow between different systems, with repeated use of light gray color for the background and clear black text for labels.
