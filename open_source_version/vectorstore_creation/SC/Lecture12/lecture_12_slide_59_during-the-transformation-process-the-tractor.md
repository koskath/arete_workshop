# Slide 59 of Lecture 12 contains information about During the transformation process the „tractor“ becomes a smart and networked product and an example from the farming industry

# Here is a Description of the Graph in slide 59 of lecture 12: Transformation of a Tractor into a Smart, Connected Product

The graph visualizes the **evolution of a traditional physical product (a tractor)** into a **smart** and eventually **smart, networked product**.  
It illustrates how digital features and connectivity transform the nature and value of a product over time.

## **1. Stage 1 — Product (Traditional Product)**
The leftmost section shows a **basic tractor**.

- It is a **purely mechanical machine**.  
- No sensors, no software, no digital capabilities.  
- Value comes from physical performance only.

This represents the **starting point** in the digital transformation journey.

## **2. Stage 2 — Smart Product**
In the middle section, the tractor becomes a **smart product**.

The tractor is shown together with a small dashboard-like icon representing **embedded intelligence**, such as:
- Sensors  
- Onboard computing  
- Diagnostics  
- Data collection  
- Basic automation

A smart product can:
- Monitor its own condition  
- Optimize performance  
- Provide analytics  
- Enable preventive maintenance

The tractor now includes **digital functionality**, but is still mostly self-contained.

## **3. Stage 3 — Smart, Connected Product**
In the rightmost section, the tractor becomes a **smart, connected product**.

New icons appear, such as:
- A smartphone/tablet  
- Wireless communication signals  

These indicate the addition of **connectivity**, e.g.:  
- Wi-Fi  
- Cellular networks  
- Cloud integration  
- IoT platforms  

The tractor now sends data to external systems and receives commands or updates.  
This allows:
- Remote monitoring  
- Remote control  
- Continuous software updates  
- Fleet coordination  
- Real-time optimization  
- Integration with farm management systems  

The tractor becomes part of a **connected ecosystem**, not just a standalone machine.

## **Overall Message**
The graph shows three phases of product transformation:

1. **Product** → purely mechanical  
2. **Smart Product** → physical + embedded digital capabilities  
3. **Smart, Connected Product** → digitally enhanced + connected to networks and other systems  

This demonstrates how digitization changes traditional equipment into intelligent, data-driven, networked systems—using the tractor as a practical example from the farming industry.
