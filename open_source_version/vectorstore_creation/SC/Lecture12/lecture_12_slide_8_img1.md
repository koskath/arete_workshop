# Slide 8 of Lecture 12 contains information about The image in slide 8 of lecture 12 features a Venn diagram with four overlapping circles, each labeled with components of production planning and control, connected to supply chain analytics:

1. **Scheduling** (Yellow Circle):
   - Connected to the question "When to do things?".
   - Reflects the timing of production tasks and resource allocation, impacting lead times and inventory levels.

2. **Loading** (Light Blue Circle):
   - Connected to the question "How much to do?".
   - Involves determining workload capacity to optimize resource utilization and balance supply with demand.

3. **Sequencing** (Green Circle):
   - Connected to the question "In what order to do things?".
   - Focuses on task order to maximize efficiency and minimize changeover times, affecting throughput and productivity.

4. **Monitoring and Control** (Purple Circle):
   - Connected to the question "Are activities going to plan?".
   - Involves tracking performance and process adjustments, crucial for maintaining quality and meeting production targets.

These components highlight key questions in production planning and control, essential for optimizing supply chain operations through analytics.
