# Slide 19 of Lecture 12 contains information about „The xRP-Logic“ …
The “xRP logic” refers to the automation of the hierarchical planning and control process. It follows a top‑down approach, working through the hierarchy step by step, from material requirement planning (MRP) through manufacturing resource planning (MRP I or MRP II), management resource planning (MRP II or MRP III, with some ambiguity in the terminology) and finally enterprise resource planning (ERP). In such systems, control is exercised through a centralised loop hierarchy: plan targets are derived analytically, and the planning results of one stage become inputs for the next stage. Feedback is used to control deviations, and countervailing measures are taken by searching for appropriate trade‑offs. 12 Digitization and Digitalization 14.03.2025 Slide 19
