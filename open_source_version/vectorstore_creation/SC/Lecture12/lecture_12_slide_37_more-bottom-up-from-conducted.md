# Slide 37 of Lecture 12 contains information about More Bottom-Up – From “conducted Orchestra” more towards the “Jazz-Combo”
In a more bottom-up approach, the metaphor shifts from a “conducted orchestra” towards a “jazz combo”. Jamming means working within a structure and living by its own dynamics: the players agree on the general theme and focus, agree on a certain rhythm and roughly agree on who plays when, thus providing a stabilizing framework. Within this framework, there is interaction with self-control and interpretation; it is unscripted instead of pre-planned and happens in “real time” with current restrictions. The emphasis is on more alignment than on the transfer and processing of plans, and “muddling through” means that the best plan is always the current one.
