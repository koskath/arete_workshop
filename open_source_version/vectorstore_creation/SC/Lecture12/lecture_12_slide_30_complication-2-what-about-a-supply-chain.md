# Slide 30 of Lecture 12 contains information about Complication 2: What about a Supply Chain – e.g. Sequenced JIT flow
In a sequenced JIT flow, there is JIT-sequenced delivery of parts to align with the production sequence, while a supplier may ship one or more different kinds of products to a vehicle. Product variation needs to match each vehicle, including seatings, instrument panels, color, door panels, fabric, style and features such as heating, airbags, etc. Shipments may be made to one or more receiving assembly lines.
