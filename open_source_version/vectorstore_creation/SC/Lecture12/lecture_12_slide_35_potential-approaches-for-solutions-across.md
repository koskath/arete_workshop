# Slide 35 of Lecture 12 contains information about Potential approaches for solutions across Boundaries - Supply Chain Towers for more visibility?

# The image in slide 35 of lecture 12 features a circular diagram illustrating a supply chain network labeled as "E2open Business Network Platform." The central figure is a "Command Center" represented by a red tower in the middle. This is surrounded by various entities depicted as buildings, encircled by a larger oval representing the platform.

**Left Section (Supply):**
1. **Components Suppliers:** A dark gray building with two small elements in front, adjacent to the label.
2. **Contract Manufacturers:** A gray building with chimneys, next to red and gray oval objects.
3. **Regional VMI Hub:** Two identical structures labeled "Regional VMI Hub." These buildings are gray with red and green oval objects at their front.
4. **ODMs:** A yellow-brown building with red and brown oval objects.

**Right Section (Demand):**
1. **Distributors:** A yellow warehouse-like building with green and brown oval objects.
2. **Regional Merge Center:** Two identical structures labeled "Regional Merge Center." These are gray buildings with red and gray oval objects.
3. **3PLs:** A yellow building with brown and green oval objects.
4. **Retailers:** Two identical buildings labeled "Retailers," comprised of a brown building with gray and red oval objects.

**Surrounding Elements:**
- The overall structure is defined by an outer gray ring split into two halves.
- The lower section of the ring encompasses two labels, "Supply" on the left in green and "Demand" on the right in green.
- The central gray area emphasizes the "Command Center" with no additional labeling.

The spatial arrangement clearly divides "Supply" side entities on the left and "Demand" side entities on the right, interconnected through the inner command center.
