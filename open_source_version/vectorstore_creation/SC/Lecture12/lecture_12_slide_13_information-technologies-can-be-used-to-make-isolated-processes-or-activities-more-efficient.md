# Slide 13 of Lecture 12 contains information about Phase 1: IT Support for basic Functions

- **Goal:** Automation of information processes for basic functions like **“MRP”** or **“billing”** in finance  
- **Benefits:** Higher efficiency for isolated processes  
- **Results:** Isolated IT solutions  
- **BUT:** Existing processes remain unchanged, potential of information technologies only partially exploited  

### Figure Description
The figure on the left shows a vertical stack of business functions inside a business unit: **Supplier**, **Finance**, **Sales**, **Production**, and others (“….”). Each function is depicted as a separate block. Lines indicate that integration is based on IT, but only within isolated functions or processes rather than across the whole organization. At the bottom, labels read:

- **Integration based on IT**  
- **Function / Process**  
- **Business Unit**
