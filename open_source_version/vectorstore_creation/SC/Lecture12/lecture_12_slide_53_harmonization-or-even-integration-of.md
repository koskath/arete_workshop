# The image in slide 52 of lecture 12 is divided into two main sections, with a yellow upper half labeled "Virtuelle" oder Informationswelt and an orange lower half labeled "Objekt"- oder physische Welt.

**Upper Half (Virtual or Information World):**
- On the top right, there is a rectangular visual of a computer screen display. The screen shows a geographical map with navigational elements, and a sidebar with an arrow pointing to the map. Text next to the screen says "Alert Monitor für Details."
- Below the screen, a series of blocks with arrows pointing to them represent various processes as follows from left to right:
  - "Demand Planning"
  - "Supply Network Planning"
  - "Prod. Planning Scheduling"
  - "ATP"
- Below this sequence, the blocks are collectively labeled "APO-Applikationen."
- To the left of these blocks, two more blocks read:
  - "Alert-Mitteilung"
  - "Message Handler"
- These two are connected by lines to "Business Information Warehouse" on the left and "Ausführung" on the right.

**Lower Half (Object or Physical World):**
- At the top, three historical representations are provided.
  - On the left, an old document labeled "Frachtbrief 1922."
  - In the middle, a barcode labeled "Barcode ab 1970."
  - On the right, an image of a digital label labeled "Smartlabel 1997."
- These three elements are connected with downward arrows to the orange section below, symbolizing the physical world.
- In the orange section are seven images representing various logistics or physical objects:
  1. A picture of a factory or warehouse vehicle.
  2. Loading dock or storage space.
  3. A segmented truck or storage area.
  4. A person in work attire handling goods.
  5. Stacked yellow crates.
  6. A hand holding a small package.
  7. Stack of envelopes.

The overall layout illustrates the relationship and evolution from physical to digital systems in logistics or information management.
