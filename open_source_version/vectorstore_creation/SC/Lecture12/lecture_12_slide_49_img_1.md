# The image 1 in slide 49 of lecture 12 contains:

1. **Substrate**: 
   - Color: Light background
   - Shape: Rectangular
   - Orientation: Landscape

2. **Antenna Pattern**:
   - Color: Dark brown metallic
   - Structure: Symmetrical design with undulating curves
   - Layout: 
     - Begins on the left with a larger rectangular block followed by three small wave-like squiggles that lead into an elongated straight section.
     - The central part features two rectangles enclosing a square-like shape with what appears to be a chip in the center, indicated by a small yellow square. 
     - The section after the central part mirrors the initial section with squiggly lines and ends with a rectangular block on the right. 

3. **Text and Annotations**:
   - Left side, beneath the initial block: "© 2005 ALIEN" in small, dark print.
   - Right side, above the rectangular block: The number "970000" in small, dark print.
   - There are some light, indistinct logos and patterns beneath the antenna design which appear to be watermarks or background elements.

Overall, the design is precise, with all elements aligned horizontally along the center axis of the substrate.
