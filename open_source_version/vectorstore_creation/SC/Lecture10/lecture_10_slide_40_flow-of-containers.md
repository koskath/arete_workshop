# Slide 40 of Lecture 10 contains information about Flow of Containers

This diagram illustrates the complete movement of containers through the international transport chain, from the shipper’s origin to the final consignee. It compares different logistics configurations—break-bulk, LCL (Less-than-Container Load), and FCL (Full Container Load)—and highlights how containers move across various stages.
At the top, the flow begins with the **shipper/origin**, followed by **pre-carriage** options (by truck, rail, or barge). Once cargo arrives at the **port of departure**, it moves through facilities such as *Kai/Kaischuppen* or packing centers (CFS). The cargo is then transported via **maritime shipping** (port to port) before reaching the **port of arrival**, where similar unpacking or processing takes place.

Depending on whether the cargo travels as break-bulk, LCL, or FCL, the diagram shows different paths:
- **Break-bulk goods** follow a simple directional flow with no container.
- **LCL shipments** are consolidated into containers and processed via Container Freight Stations (CFS).
- **FCL shipments** move through container terminals and yards, following a more streamlined flow.

The final stage is **on-carriage**, again by truck, rail, or barge, until the shipment reaches the **consignee/destination**.

The section circled in red highlights the **haulage responsibility and container utilization** during pre-carriage and on-carriage:
- **Carrier’s haulage vs. merchant’s haulage** determines who organizes the inland transport.
- Containers may move as:
  - **Full runs**, when loaded with cargo.
  - **Empty runs**, when repositioned without cargo—an important cost and efficiency issue in container logistics.

Overall, the diagram visualizes how containers transition across multiple handling points and modes, illustrating both the operational complexity and the coordination required across the global supply chain.
