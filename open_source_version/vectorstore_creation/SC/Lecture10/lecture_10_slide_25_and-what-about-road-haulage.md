# Slide 25 of Lecture 10 contains information about And what about Road Haulage?

This slide presents a case study from the International Road Transport Union about the TIR system implementation for China-to-Europe trade corridors. The press release is dated November 27, 2018 from Beijing and announces the successful completion of the first China to Europe TIR truck journey in record time.
The photograph shows a TIR-certified truck branded with "alblas" passing through what appears to be an automated customs or border checkpoint facility. The scene includes scanning gates, security infrastructure, and personnel in high-visibility safety vests conducting inspections under winter conditions with snow visible on the ground.
The main text explains that the success of this first TIR journey by road from China to Europe proves the system's advantages in terms of cost, time, and security. The initiative is positioned to boost trade between China and Europe by unlocking a critical Belt and Road route and offering development opportunities across Eurasia.
From a supply chain analytics perspective, this case demonstrates several important concepts. The TIR system provides a framework for analyzing modal efficiency in international freight transport, showing how road transport can serve as an alternative or complement to rail and maritime options. The achievement of record delivery times highlights the importance of corridor performance metrics including time, cost, and security key performance indicators for long-distance haulage operations.
The border checkpoint infrastructure visible in the image represents the optimization of customs procedures and the reduction of dwell time at crossing points, which is critical for supply chain velocity. The integration of physical inspection facilities with digital tracking systems demonstrates how technology enhances cargo visibility and control throughout the journey.
This example is particularly relevant for understanding how international transport conventions like TIR reduce friction in cross-border logistics. By standardizing documentation and customs procedures across multiple countries, the system directly impacts supply chain predictability, total landed costs, and the overall efficiency of long-distance overland trade routes. The strategic importance of diversifying trade routes beyond traditional maritime channels is also evident, particularly in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative connecting Asian and European markets.
