# Slide 9 of Lecture 10 contains information about Multimodal, Intermodal and Combined Transport

# The diagram in slide 9 of lecture 10 presents four different transport concepts used in supply chain and logistics.  
Each row shows: **Pre-Carriage → Main Haul → Onward Carriage**, along with the equipment or transport mode involved.



## 1. Containerised Multimodal Transport
- **Pre-Carriage:** A truck transports a container to a terminal.
- **Main Haul:** The container is moved by a large container ship, inland waterway vessel, or by rail. Cranes are shown handling containers.
- **Onward Carriage:** A truck collects the container from the destination terminal and delivers it onward.

*Key point:* The cargo stays inside a **standard container**, but multiple transport modes are used under one contract.

## 2. Accompanied Intermodal Transport
- **Pre-Carriage:** A truck with its trailer drives to a terminal.
- **Main Haul:** The truck (tractor + trailer) boards a **Ro/Ro ferry** or a **rolling road** train. The driver accompanies the vehicle during the journey.
- **Onward Carriage:** The same truck drives off the vessel/train and continues to the final destination.

*Key point:* The entire road vehicle is transported, and the driver travels with it.

---

## 3. Un-Accompanied Intermodal Transport
- **Pre-Carriage:** A truck brings a trailer or container to the terminal.
- **Main Haul:** The **trailer or load unit** (not the tractor and not the driver) is loaded onto a Ro/Ro ferry or piggy-back train using lifting equipment.
- **Onward Carriage:** A local trucking unit picks up the trailer or container at the destination.

*Key point:* Only the cargo unit moves across modes; the road vehicle and driver do not accompany it.

## 4. Airfreight Operations
- **Pre-Carriage:** A truck collects freight and drives to an air-cargo terminal.
- **Main Haul:** The cargo is flown by airplane (airfreight) or transported via air-cargo trucking networks.
- **Onward Carriage:** A truck distributes the cargo from the arrival airport to the final consignee.

*Key point:* Air transport serves as the main haul, with road transport used at both ends.

## Summary
Across all four rows, the diagram illustrates how different combinations of trucks, ships, trains, and aircraft are used to move goods.  
The main difference between categories lies in **how the cargo unit is handled**, **whether the driver accompanies the load**, and **what equipment transfers across modes**.
