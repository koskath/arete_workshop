# Slide 42 of Lecture 10 contains information about Physical Flow – Description of the Slide

This slide visualizes the **physical movement of a container** through the logistics chain and contrasts Jessica’s **best option** (in blue) with **alternative, less efficient flows** (in red). It complements the earlier “Information Flow” slide by showing how the physical shipment actually travels across different transport modes and nodes.
At the starting point, the **Exporter/Shipper** hands over the cargo. Two potential pathways emerge:

### Best Option (Blue Path)
The blue arrows present the streamlined, efficient physical route Jessica prefers:
1. The **Trucker** collects the container directly from the exporter.  
2. The truck moves it to the **Railway Terminal**, avoiding unnecessary stops.  
3. From there, the **Railway Operator** transports the container to the **Seaport Terminal**.  
4. At the terminal, the container is transferred to the **Ocean Carrier**, ready for the maritime leg.  

This path minimizes delays, avoids redundant handling, and reduces the risk of damage or misrouting. It represents a clean “land → rail → sea” multimodal chain with only essential touchpoints.

### Alternative Flows (Red Path)
The red lines illustrate what might happen if coordination breaks down or if suboptimal decisions are made:
- The cargo may loop inefficiently between the **Exporter**, **Trucker**, and **Inland Container Depot**, adding unnecessary legs.  
- Containers may be routed to the **Inland Depot** even when not needed, increasing handling time and cost.  
- The shipment may be taken on excessively long detours before reaching the port.  
- At the seaport, cargo might first go to the **Container Depot at the Seaport**, adding extra repositioning before finally reaching the terminal.  

These red paths reflect real-world logistical inefficiencies—extra handling, idle time, avoidable movements—often caused by poor planning, miscommunication, or outdated processes.

### Core Message
The comparison between blue and red pathways shows how **freight forwarders like Jessica must design the most efficient physical route**, balancing:
- time  
- cost  
- reliability  
- modal coordination  

It reinforces a central lesson from the lecture: in logistics, **minimizing unnecessary movements is as important as managing information**, and well-designed transport chains dramatically improve supply chain performance.
