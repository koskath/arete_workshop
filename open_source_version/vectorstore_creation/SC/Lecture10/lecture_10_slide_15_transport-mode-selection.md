# Slide 15 of Lecture 10 contains information about Transport Mode Selection

A function of:
- Weight/volume and value of the freight
- Distance travelled
- Availability / reliability of transport services
- Freight rates to be charged
- ...

Instead of tare weight, carriers alternatively apply volumetric charging based on consignment dimensions (usually abbreviated by W/M):

- Road/rail 1:3 or 1 cbm = 333 kg
- Sea freight 1:1 or 1 cbm = 1,000 kg
- Air freight 1:6 or 1 cbm = 666 kg

Always the higher one is taken!
