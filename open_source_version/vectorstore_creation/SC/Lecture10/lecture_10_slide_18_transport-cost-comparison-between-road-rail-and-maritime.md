# Slide 18 of Lecture 10 contains information about Transport Cost Comparison between Road, Rail and Maritime

# Here is what the graph in slide 18 of lecture 9 contains:

- A graph with the X-axis labeled "Distance" and the Y-axis labeled "Transport costs per unit."
- Three lines representing different transport modes:
  - "Road" is represented by a blue line (C1) that starts lower on the Y-axis and increases steeply.
  - "Rail" is depicted by a yellow line (C2) that starts midway on the Y-axis and has a moderate slope.
  - "Maritime" is shown by a green line (C3) that starts higher on the Y-axis and has a gradual slope.
- Two vertical dashed lines labeled "D1" and "D2" indicating thresholds or breakpoints in distance.
- Intersection points of the lines where the transport costs change relative to each other at D1 and D2.
- Labels next to lines indicating modes: "Road," "Rail," and "Maritime."
