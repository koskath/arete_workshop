# Slide 50 of Lecture 10 contains information about Maritime Containers by Ownership in TEU (1990–2023)

This slide shows a stacked bar chart illustrating the growth of the global maritime container fleet from **1990 to 2023**, broken down by **ownership type**:

- **Carrier-owned containers** (dark blue)
- **Leasing company-owned containers** (green)
- **Other owners** (red)

## Key Observations

### 1. Massive overall growth in the global container fleet  
From roughly **6–7 million TEU in 1990** to **over 50 million TEU in 2023**, the container pool has expanded almost **eightfold**. This reflects:
- Expansion of global trade  
- Increased containerization  
- Longer and more complex supply chains  

### 2. Carrier-owned share grows steadily  
Carrier-owned boxes (dark blue) rise consistently over the years.  
- In the 1990s, carriers owned the **majority** of container equipment.  
- Growth continues in absolute terms, especially after 2010.  
- Post-2020 (COVID era), carriers invested heavily in container equipment due to shortages.

### 3. Leasing companies gain a dominant role  
The green bars show that leasing companies have become crucial players.
- From a small share in the early 1990s, leasing companies now own **a very large share of global container assets**.
- Leasing companies allow carriers to flex capacity without owning all equipment, which is essential given demand volatility.

### 4. “Others” remain a very small fraction  
Shippers and independent owners (red) represent only a minor portion of global ownership and remain relatively stable.

## Broader Insights

- **Industry structure is shifting:** leasing companies now play a central financial role in the container supply chain.
- **Carriers increased ownership during crises:** especially around 2020–2022, when shortages pushed carriers to secure their own equipment.
- **Capital intensity and asset flexibility:** leasing offers carriers a way to reduce CAPEX and manage cycles, while carriers still maintain a significant controlled fleet.

## Why This Matters (Lecture Context)

This chart connects to themes in global logistics such as:
- **Asset ownership strategies**
- **Risk management in shipping**
- **The influence of financial players (lessors) in transport chains**
- **How container availability affects supply chain reliability**

Overall, the slide illustrates the **evolution of container ownership as a strategic and financial backbone** of the maritime logistics industry.
