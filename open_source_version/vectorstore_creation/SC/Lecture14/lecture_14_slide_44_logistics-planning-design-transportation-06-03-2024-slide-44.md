This collage of recent news articles illustrates the accelerating consolidation and vertical integration taking place across global logistics and supply chain industries. The headlines highlight major acquisitions by leading players such as **CMA CGM**, **MSC**, **Maersk**, and others as they purchase container terminals, freight forwarders, tugboat operators, air-cargo assets, and even airlines. These moves reflect a strategic shift noted earlier in the lecture: global supply chain governance is increasingly shaped by powerful “lead firms” that seek to control more stages of the value chain.
These developments connect directly to concepts such as **Gereffi’s global governance types**, **strategic scope**, and **supply chain configurations**. Carriers are no longer merely transport providers—they are transforming into **integrated logistics platforms** spanning shipping, terminals, warehousing, air freight, last-mile services, and digital platforms. This mirrors the move from “market” governance toward **modular**, **relational**, and even **hierarchical** modes, where power asymmetry increases and coordination becomes more explicit.
The examples also relate to earlier discussions on **value creation**, **value pools**, and **postponement**. By acquiring upstream and downstream capabilities, firms aim to capture more value, strengthen customer lock-in, and reduce dependency on intermediaries. The trend also reinforces topics like **factory gate pricing**, **channel integration**, and the strategic question of “who should do it?”—whether the manufacturer, retailer, or logistics service provider should orchestrate the chain.
Overall, the image demonstrates how real-world industry dynamics reflect the theoretical frameworks from the course: the reconfiguration of global supply chains, the rise of dominant actors, and the strategic importance of end-to-end integration in an increasingly complex and competitive logistics landscape.
