# Slide 43 of Lecture 14 contains information about The options – who should do it? See book chapter: Factory gate pricing!!

The image illustrates three different options for “who integrates the distribution channel” within a supply chain, framed in the context of factory gate pricing. Each option highlights which actor—**manufacturer**, **retailer**, or **logistics service provider (LSP)**—takes responsibility for coordinating transportation and logistics activities.
In the first scenario, the **manufacturer integrates the channel**. The manufacturer organizes the logistics flows from production to the retailer, with the LSP acting mainly as an outsourced operator. In the second scenario, the **retailer integrates the channel**, assuming control of inbound logistics and coordinating the LSP to manage flows from multiple suppliers. In the third scenario, the **LSP integrates the channel**, becoming the central orchestrator and managing transport and consolidation between manufacturers and retailers.
The red-dashed boxes highlight where integration shifts across these three configurations. The slide invites discussion of the benefits and disadvantages of each option—such as cost transparency, negotiating power, coordination efficiency, and potential conflicts of interest.
