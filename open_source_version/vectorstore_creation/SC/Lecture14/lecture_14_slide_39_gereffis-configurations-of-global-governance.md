# Slide 39 of Lecture 14 contains information about Gereffis‘ Configurations of Global Governance Focal Actor, lead firms etc.

The image illustrates Gereffi’s five configurations of global value chain governance, arranged from left to right along two axes: increasing **explicit coordination** and increasing **power asymmetry** between firms. 
The first configuration, **Market**, shows a simple structure where suppliers and customers interact primarily through price signals. There is little coordination, and firms operate independently with low power differences. 
The second, **Modular**, features a lead firm relying on “full-package suppliers” who can take detailed specifications and deliver complete modules. Coordination increases through standardized interfaces, but power is still relatively balanced.
The third, **Relational**, depicts a lead firm working closely with relational suppliers. The diagram uses two-way arrows to emphasize trust-based, collaborative, and information-rich exchanges. Dependence and coordination increase due to asset specificity and joint problem-solving.
The fourth configuration, **Captive**, shows a dominant lead firm directing multiple smaller suppliers. Power asymmetry is high: suppliers depend heavily on the lead firm, which imposes strict oversight and detailed instructions.
Finally, **Hierarchy** represents a fully **vertically integrated firm**. All activities are internalized, illustrated by a single large downward arrow. Coordination is highest because everything happens within one organization, and power is fully centralized.
Along the left side, a vertical arrow labeled *Value Chain* connects materials at the bottom to end use at the top, situating the governance types within broader value-creation stages.
