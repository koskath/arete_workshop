# Slide 10 of Lecture 14 contains information about The image in slide 10 of lecture 14 uses the metaphor of a round table to illustrate the concept of organizational "flatness" in supply chain management:
The round table is significant because it has no head position - everyone seated at it is theoretically equal. In traditional organizational structures and supply chains, relationships were hierarchical with clear power dynamics, reporting lines, and vertical authority structures. Companies had many layers of management, and supply chain relationships were often based on dominance and subordination.
The "flat" concept represents the shift away from these rigid hierarchies toward more collaborative, networked structures. At a round table, all participants can see each other, communicate directly, and contribute equally to discussions. There are no intermediary layers blocking communication or creating distance between participants.
In supply chain terms, this flatness means fewer organizational layers within companies, more direct communication between supply chain partners, and relationships based on collaboration rather than command-and-control. Partners work together as equals rather than as superior-subordinate relationships.
The image suggests that before the world became "flatter" through globalization and technology, organizations needed to adopt this round-table approach internally - breaking down hierarchical barriers and enabling cross-functional collaboration. This internal flattening was a prerequisite for the broader flattening of global supply chains that would follow.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
