# Slide 21 of Lecture 14 contains information about There are also other criteria? What are the criteria?

This slide explains that, beyond simple cost-based decisions, companies use different analytical criteria to classify materials for inventory control. Two widely used methods are presented: **ABC analysis** and **XYZ analysis**, each focusing on a different dimension of inventory management—purchasing volume and demand continuity.
On the left, the slide introduces **ABC Analysis**, which categorizes items into three groups (A, B, and C) based on their **purchasing volume or value contribution**. A small text box explains that this method ranks items according to their importance:  
- **A-items** represent a small share of total quantity but a very high share of total value;  
- **B-items** fall in the middle range;  
- **C-items** represent the majority of quantity but only a small portion of value.  

Below this explanation, a diagram visualizes the ABC model. The horizontal axis shows cumulative quantity, while the vertical axis shows cumulative value. The shaded regions labeled A, B, and C illustrate how the categories are divided: A-items occupy the steep initial segment, B-items the middle section, and C-items the flatter, long-tail portion.

On the right, the slide introduces **XYZ Analysis**, which classifies materials based on **demand continuity and forecast accuracy** rather than value. A text box explains that this method evaluates consumption patterns to determine how predictable demand is. The classification includes three groups:  
- **X-class:** Items with stable, regular demand and high forecast accuracy;  
- **Y-class:** Items with trend-driven or seasonal demand, offering medium forecast accuracy;  
- **Z-class:** Items with irregular, erratic consumption where forecast accuracy is very low.  

Together, the ABC and XYZ analyses provide a more sophisticated view of inventory management by evaluating materials both in terms of **economic importance** and **predictability of demand**, enabling better prioritization, planning, and control decisions.
