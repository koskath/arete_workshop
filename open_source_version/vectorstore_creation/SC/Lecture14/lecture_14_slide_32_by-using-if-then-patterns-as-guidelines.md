# Slide 32 of Lecture 14 contains information about By using “if-then-patterns” as guidelines:
By using “if-then-patterns” as guidelines, Fishers Typology based on the products can be applied to link specific
product characteristics to appropriate strategic choices.

The image presents Fisher’s well-known framework that links product characteristics to the appropriate supply chain strategy. The diagram is shown as a 2×2 matrix, with **product type** along the top and **supply chain type** along the left side.
Across the top, products are classified as:
- **Functional products**: long life cycle (> 2 years), low product variety, and low gross margin (< 35%).
- **Innovative products**: short life cycle (< 1 year), high product variety, and high gross margin (> 35%).

On the left, supply chains are categorized as:
- **Efficient supply chains**, designed to meet predictable demand at the lowest cost.
- **Responsive supply chains**, designed to react quickly to unpredictable demand and avoid stockouts, markdowns, and obsolescence.

Inside the matrix, each quadrant is labeled either **“match”** or **“mismatch.”**  
- Functional products paired with efficient supply chains are a **match** (green).  
- Innovative products paired with responsive supply chains are also a **match** (green).  
- The other two combinations—functional products with responsive chains and innovative products with efficient chains—are **mismatches** (red), indicating poor strategic alignment.

Overall, the image communicates the core idea behind Fisher’s typology: companies should align their supply chain design with the nature of the products they offer, using these "if-then" rules as a guideline for strategic fit.
