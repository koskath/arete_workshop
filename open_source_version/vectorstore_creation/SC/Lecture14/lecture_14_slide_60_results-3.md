# Slide 60 of Lecture 14 contains information about Results 3
In Results 3 we are Calculating Policy & Other Factors for ABC Corp. and XYZ Corp. In this Policy & Other Factors
ABC Corp. XYZ Corp. comparison, we consider a Quoted Price: $10.00 $12.00 together with Recycle: 0 - $0.6,
which corresponds to (- 5 %) (No) (Yes), and Heroics: 0 - $0.36, which corresponds to (- 1 % each) (None)
(3 times). We also take into account Other Preferences: ? ?, including (e.g. Culture) (American) (Danish) and
(e.g. Info. about supplier) (Yes) (Yes), so that all relevant policy and other factors for ABC Corp. and XYZ Corp.
are reflected.

This slide shows the combined effect of cost factors and performance factors in a single consolidated table. All previously calculated adjustments (freight, discounts, on-time delivery, quality, and lead time) are added to the quoted price.
At this stage:ABC’s total cost grows substantially due to weak delivery, high defects, and slow lead time. XYZ’s total cost increases only slightly, mainly from freight and lead-time adjustments.

This provides the first full view of which supplier is actually more expensive when realistic operational costs are included.
