# The image 1 in slide 27 of lecture 14 contains:
The image is a flowchart-like diagram with various colored sections and labels, illustrating aspects of Manufacturing Resources Planning (MRP I) and Management Resources Planning (MRP II). The layout is primarily organized within three distinct areas: yellow, blue, and tan.

1. **Yellow Border**: 
   - The outermost layer is a pale yellow border containing the primary headings:
     - Upper left corner: "MRP I Manufacturing Resources Planning" inside a gray rectangle.
     - Upper right corner: "MRP II Management Resources Planning" inside another gray rectangle.
     - Two boxes at the top:
       - "Vertriebsplanung"
       - "Entwicklungsplanung"

2. **Blue Central Area**: 
   - A central blue rectangle contains several interconnected processes related to MRP, structured in rows with boxes linked by black arrows.
   - Top box: "Produktionsprogramm" across the width of the blue area with a curved arrow below.
   - Middle section includes:
     - Two vertically stacked boxes connected with a downward arrow:
       - "Bruttobedarfserrechnung (Stücklistenauflösung)" highlighted with an orange border and background.
       - "Nettobedarfserrechnung" inside a gray-bordered box with an orange outline.
     - To the left, vertically aligned boxes connected with right-pointing arrows: 
       - "Stückliste"
       - "Lager-bestände"
       - "Vorlauf-Zeiten"
     - To the right, vertically aligned shaded boxes with hatch patterns:
       - "Mengen-planung"
       - "Termin-planung"
   - Lower section includes three vertically aligned boxes:
     - "Bedarfsoptimierung"
     - "Bildung von Fertigungs- und Montagelosen"
     - "Kapazitätsbelastung der Lose" 
   - At the bottom of the blue area:
     - Two boxes:
       - "Kapazitätsangebot" to the left of "Kapazitätsbedarfs-planung" with arrows leading downwards.

3. **Tan Boxes and Connections**:
   - Several tan-colored boxes are positioned vertically at the bottom:
     - "Werkstattsteuerung"

4. **Additional Labeling**: 
   - A box labeled "MRP Material Requirement Planning" is connected with dashed lines to the orange-bordered "Bruttobedarfserrechnung" box.

The overall diagram indicates the flow and interconnection of various planning and capacity functions within Manufacturing and Management Resources Planning. Each box represents a distinct component or process, with directional arrows indicating the sequence or influence of these processes.
