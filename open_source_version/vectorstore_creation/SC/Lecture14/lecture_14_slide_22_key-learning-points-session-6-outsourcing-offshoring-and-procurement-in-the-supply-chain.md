# Slide 22 of Lecture 14 contains information about Key learning points – Session 6 Outsourcing, Offshoring and Procurement in the Supply Chain
Literature and content in this session focus on outsourcing, offshoring and procurement in the supply chain. On the **content** side, topics include sourcing versus procurement, supplier selection and the procurement process, outsourcing versus off‑shoring, and key analytical tools such as the Kraljik Matrix, Total Cost of Ownership by supplier, the OLI‑Framework and the Unit Total Cost (UTC) approach. The **literature** base for these ideas includes Almquist, E., Caleghorn, J. and Sherer, L. (2018), “The B2B Elements of Value” (*Harvard Business Review*, Vol. 96, No. 2, pp. 72–81); Kraljic, P. (1983), “Purchasing Must Become Supply Management” (*Harvard Business Review*, Vol. 61, No. 5, pp. 109–117); Trent, R. and Monczka, M. (2005), “Achieving Excellence in Global Sourcing” (*MIT Sloan Management Review*, Vol. 47, No. 1, pp. 24–32); and Harding, M. L. (2007), “Gauging Total Costs” (*Supply Chain Quarterly*, 12/2007). These materials raise several main issues and broad questions: **Why do companies outsource and/or go offshore, and what is the difference? What are the key components of a procurement process? What criteria may be used to select suppliers and to define different types of supplier relationships?**
