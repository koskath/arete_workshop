# Slide 59 of Lecture 14 contains information about Results 2
In Results 2 we are Calculating Performance Factors by making a Performance Factor ABC Corp. XYZ Corp. comparison.
In this comparison, the Quoted Price: $10.00 $12.00 provides the starting point, after which On-time delivery:
+ $1.5 0 is considered together with (1- % on-time) (85% on time) (100%). Quality: + $1.3 0 is evaluated alongside
(% rejects) (13% rejects) (No rejects), and Lead time: + $1.0 + $0.84 is assessed together with (1% / week)
(10 weeks) (7 weeks), so that all performance-related aspects for ABC Corp. and XYZ Corp. are reflected in a single paragraph.

This slide adds the performance dimensions to the comparison, translating non-price differences into monetary penalties or benefits. ABC is penalized for weaker performance:
On-time delivery: ABC is only 85% on time, leading to significant additional cost, while XYZ is 100% on time.
Quality: ABC has a 13% reject rate, causing additional cost for rework or shortages; XYZ had no rejects.
Lead time: ABC requires 10 weeks, longer than XYZ’s 7 weeks, generating an extra delay penalty.

Once performance metrics are monetized, ABC becomes significantly more expensive than XYZ—even before considering sustainability or “heroic” behavior.
