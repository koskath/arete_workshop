# Slide 50 of Lecture 14 contains information about Alternative fuel – e.g. LNG was it an option?

The picture illustrates the role of LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) as a potential alternative marine fuel. On the left, the slide lists LNG’s environmental benefits—such as lower CO₂ emissions, major reductions in SOx and particulate matter, and notable NOx abatements—reinforcing why LNG was once considered a promising “cleaner” fuel for shipping. On the right, a graph from the U.S. Energy Information Administration compares historical and projected prices of crude oil and natural gas, showing natural gas as consistently cheaper. Above this, a ship schematic highlights the space needed on board for LNG storage tanks, hinting at the logistical and technical constraints of LNG adoption. Together, the visuals emphasize both the environmental advantages and the practical challenges (investment, bunkering infrastructure, price uncertainty) associated with using LNG in maritime transport.
