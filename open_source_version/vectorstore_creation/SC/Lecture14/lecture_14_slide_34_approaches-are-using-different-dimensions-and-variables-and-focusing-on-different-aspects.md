# Slide 34 of Lecture 14 contains information about Approaches are using different dimensions and variables and focusing on different aspects

The table summarizes how various authors conceptualize supply chain configurations by focusing on different dimensions and proposing different structural models. It is divided into three columns: **Authors**, **Dimensions**, and **Configurations**.
In the first column, several key scholars and publication years are listed, including Fisher (1997), Tan et al. (2000), Christopher (2000), Mason-Jones/Naylor/Towill (2000), Lee (2002), Corsten & Gabriel (2002), and Klaas (2003). Each author has contributed a different perspective on how supply chains can be categorized.
The second column outlines the **dimensions** that each author uses to analyze supply chains. These range from uncertainty of demand and product characteristics (Fisher, Tan et al.), to variability and volume (Christopher), to hybrid dimensions combining multiple factors (Mason-Jones et al.). Others look at demand and supply characteristics (Lee), demand uncertainty and product structure (Corsten & Gabriel), or strategic goals and coordination mechanisms (Klaas).
The third column lists the resulting **supply chain configurations** proposed by each author. Examples include Fisher’s distinction between physically efficient and market-responsive processes, Christopher’s agile and lean supply chains, and the “leagile” hybrid model from Mason-Jones et al. Lee presents four configurations—efficient, responsive, risk-hedging, and agile supply chains—while Corsten & Gabriel identify lean, connected, agile, and speed-focused supply chains. Klaas differentiates logistics segments such as tight, agile, modular, and individual.
Overall, the table illustrates that while different authors emphasize different variables, they all aim to classify supply chains into coherent strategic configurations that support better alignment between supply chain design and environmental or product-specific requirements.
