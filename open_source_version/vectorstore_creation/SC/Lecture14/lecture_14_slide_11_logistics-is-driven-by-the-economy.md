# Slide 11 of Lecture 14 contains information about Logistics is driven by the economy
Logistics is fundamentally driven by developments in the economy, and increasing globalisation has far‑reaching consequences for logistics and supply chain management. As globalisation progresses, assembly and selling activities are influenced by a more intense **division of labour**, which in turn drives the use of plastics, bodies, software, keyboards (Tastatur) and other components, while also increasing the main storage distances that goods must travel in transportation. At the same time, new barriers emerge in **communication**, including differences in language, cultures and technologies, which can complicate coordination across borders. Moreover, there is growing **global competition for logistics service providers**, which raises the bar for performance and innovation. These changes require **different kinds of control** and create a need for **new competencies**, making logistics and supply chain management more challenging. Consequently, firms face greater **complexity** and heightened **risks**.

The image illustrates how **globalisation shapes logistics and supply chain management**. The background shows a world map with arrows and aircraft images, symbolising the long-distance movement of goods across continents. The planes depicted — including oversized cargo aircraft like the Dreamlifter and the Airbus Beluga — highlight how global supply chains require highly specialised logistics equipment capable of transporting large components over vast distances. This visual reinforces the idea that modern production is geographically fragmented, with different stages of manufacturing spread across the world.
On the right, the slide lists the **key consequences of increasing globalisation** for logistics and SCM. Globalisation leads to a stronger division of labour, meaning different countries specialise in different production steps. This increases transportation needs and lengthens supply chains. It also introduces new barriers — differences in language, culture, and technology — which make coordination more challenging. Because companies now operate in a global environment, logistics service providers face international competition. Supply chains require new forms of control, new competencies, and more advanced management tools to handle their growing **complexity**. Finally, globalisation increases exposure to various risks, such as delays, disruptions, and political or economic instability. Overall, the image visually and textually communicates that global supply chains are becoming longer, more interconnected, and more demanding to manage.
