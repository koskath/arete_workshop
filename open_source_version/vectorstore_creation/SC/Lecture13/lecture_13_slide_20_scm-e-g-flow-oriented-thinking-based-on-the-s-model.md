# Slide 20 of Lecture 13 contains information about SCM – e.g. Flow Oriented Thinking based on the „S“-model: four generic Processes and related main Challenges
Flow‑oriented thinking in supply chain management, as illustrated by the “S”‑model, identifies four generic processes and their related main challenges. The first process is **Supply Chain Awareness**, which involves developing new business and supply chain ideas and developing products, thereby ensuring that the supply chain is considered early in innovation and business development. The second process is **Supply Chain Structure**, where the challenge is to configure the physical network and optimize resource allocation and facility location so that the entire system supports strategic goals. The third process, **Integrated Processes**, focuses on integrating organisations, information systems and human resources into effective and efficient flows, which requires coordination and alignment across many functions and partners. Finally, **Adaptation and Development** aims to keep the supply chain “state‑of‑the‑art” and to adopt emerging technologies and ideas, ensuring that the system evolves over time. These four processes and challenges are summarised in Strategy & Configuration Slide 20.
