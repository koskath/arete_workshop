# The image 1 in slide 48 of lecture 13 contains:
The image contains a network diagram titled "T Plant." It is divided into three main sections labeled as "End items" at the top, and "Inputs" at the bottom. The diagram is composed of connected nodes represented by pink circles and arrows indicating direction.

At the top, the "End items" section has two rows of nodes. The topmost row contains six circles. Below them, in a staggered formation, are five circles positioned so that they each align between two circles from the top row. Arrows point from each top circle downward and toward the horizontally adjacent bottom row circles.

Below this, three vertical columns are formed which extend into the "Inputs" section. Each column consists of four vertically aligned circles connected by downward arrows. The left and right columns start from the second row and have arrows pointing vertically downward across all circles. The middle column starts from the center circle of the second row.

Arrows are also seen crossing horizontally within the second row of circles, forming an interconnected network among these middle circles. The points where arrows intersect show connectivity between multiple circles.

Overall, the diagram displays a structured flow from "End items" at the top to "Inputs" at the bottom through interconnected pathways involving nodes and directional arrows.
