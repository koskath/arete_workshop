# The image 1 in slide 41 of lecture 13 contains:
The image is a flowchart that illustrates a supply chain process, specifically highlighting the stages from "Raw Materials" to "End customer." The flow is divided into sections, with detailed annotations and labels indicating various operations, stages, and influences on this process.

1. **Background and Header**:
   - At the very top, within a blue rectangle, there are bullet points stating:
     - "Low level of demand uncertainty"
     - "High delivery cost (% to the unit price)"

2. **Main Flowchart**:
   - A linear horizontal flow is depicted from left to right, divided into several segments:
     - On the far left, there is a yellow vertical rectangle labeled "Raw Materials."
     - On the far right, another yellow vertical rectangle reads "End customer."

3. **Flow Line and Annotations**:
   - A horizontal black line connects the different stages, labeled with the word "Push" above it.
   - Below the line, the stages are labeled sequentially from left to right:
     - "Production" with an upwards arrow leading to the line,
     - "Assembly" also with an upwards arrow,
     - "Manufacturer DC" with an upwards arrow,
     - "Distributor DC" with an upwards arrow,
     - "Store" with an upwards arrow leading to the horizontal line leading to "End customer."
   - From "Distributor DC" to "End customer," an arrow labeled "Pull from customer demand" points leftward back to the "Distributor DC."

4. **Additional Details**:
   - Above the "Distributor DC," there is a black box with the text: "Demand forecast made at Distributor DC." A red vertical arrow also points upwards toward this box.
   - A wide white box located above the center of the diagram contains text: 
     - "Very predictable distribution patterns. Because high level of predictability, orders can be made on long-term forecast.”
   - In the upper right corner, an independent white box contains the text: "Pasta Soup drinks."

This structured framework suggests an overarching emphasis on demand predictability and its impact on order forecasting within the supply chain structure.
