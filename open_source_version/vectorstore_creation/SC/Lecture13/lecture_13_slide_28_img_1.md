# The image 1 in slide 28 of lecture 13 contains:
The image contains a 2x2 matrix with annotations and labels depicting supply chain strategies aligned with product types. The matrix is divided into four quadrants:

1. **Top-Left Quadrant**: 
   - Background color: Green
   - Label: "match"
   - Aligned with the vertical title "Efficient Supply Chain" (left side) and horizontal label "Functional Products" (top side).

2. **Top-Right Quadrant**: 
   - Background color: Red
   - Label: "mismatch"
   - Aligned with the vertical title "Efficient Supply Chain" (left side) and horizontal label "Innovative Products" (top side).

3. **Bottom-Left Quadrant**: 
   - Background color: Red
   - Label: "mismatch"
   - Aligned with the vertical title "Responsive Supply Chain" (left side) and horizontal label "Functional Products" (top side).

4. **Bottom-Right Quadrant**: 
   - Background color: Green
   - Label: "match"
   - Aligned with the vertical title "Responsive Supply Chain" (left side) and horizontal label "Innovative Products" (top side).

**Above the Matrix**:
- Under "Functional Products": 
  - Text: "Life cycle > 2 years, Gross Margin < 35%, Low Product Variety"
  - Arrow pointing downward, colored green.

- Under "Innovative Products": 
  - Text: "Life cycle < 1 year, Gross Margin > 35%, High Product Variety"
  - Arrow pointing downward, colored blue.

**To the Left of the Matrix**:
- Adjacent to "Efficient Supply Chain":
  - Text: "Supply predictable demand efficiently at lowest cost"
  - Gray arrow pointing right.

- Adjacent to "Responsive Supply Chain":
  - Text: "Respond quickly to unpredictable demand to minimize stockouts, markdowns, and obsolete inventory"
  - Gray arrow pointing right.
