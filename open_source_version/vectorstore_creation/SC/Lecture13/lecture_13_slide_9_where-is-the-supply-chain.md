# Slide 9 of Lecture 13 contains information about Where is the Supply Chain??
To understand where the supply chain fits, we can embed it within the broader strategic management process that links vision and mission to day‑to‑day operations. Organisations start from their **vision and mission**, and then conduct an **external analysis** and an **internal analysis**, bringing these together in a SWOT framework that identifies opportunities and threats on the one hand and strengths and weaknesses on the other. On the basis of this analysis, they formulate **business strategy** and make **strategic choices** that determine how the supply chain should be configured and managed. These strategic decisions are then translated into **strategy implementation and tactics**, which involve designing the organisational structure, planning processes, and control systems that guide supply chain activities. Over time, **organisational succession**, ongoing planning and feedback loops ensure that the supply chain remains aligned with the firm’s strategic objectives, as outlined in Strategy & Configuration Slide 9.
