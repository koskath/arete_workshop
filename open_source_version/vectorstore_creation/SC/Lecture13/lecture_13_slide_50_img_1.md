# The image 1 in slide 50 of lecture 13 contains:
Directly inside the image, two main sections are outlined, one labeled "Direct distribution" and the other "Warehousing," both within a blue background, separated by a thick, gray, vertical divider line on the right.

### Top Section: Direct Distribution

- **Left Column: Suppliers**
  - **Supplier A, B, C:** Each supplier is depicted with a small icon resembling a factory or warehouse with colored boxes beside it.
  - These suppliers are arranged vertically, labeled "Supplier A," "Supplier B," and "Supplier C."

- **Center: Connections to Customers**
  - Three customers labeled "Customer A," "Customer B," and "Customer C," represented as colored rectangles (light blue, light green, dark brown, respectively).
  - Arrows drawn from each supplier leading directly to each customer, illustrating a network of direct connections.
  - All arrows have black, continuous lines, except between Supplier A and Customer B, which is dotted.

- **Right Column: Points and Details**
  - Bullet points detailing:
    - "Multiple trucks arriving at inbound docks are a driver of complexity"
    - "Only limited economies of scale, mostly at the expense of more frequent replenishment cycles (full truck load (FTL) shipments not possible)"

### Bottom Section: Warehousing

- **Left Column: Suppliers**
  - Same visual representation and labeling for Suppliers A, B, and C.

- **Center: Storage and Connections**
  - A yellow rectangle with the label "Storage" positioned centrally.
  - Arrows from each supplier to "Storage," then arrows from "Storage" extending to each customer (Customer A, B, C), showing indirect connections via storage.

- **Right Column: Points and Details**
  - Bullet points detailing:
    - "Improved customer service by keeping products on stock close to the customer"
    - "Optimized transportation costs by using FTL shipments, but at the expense of higher average inventory levels"
    - "Additional inventory and warehousing costs (facility, space and handling)"
