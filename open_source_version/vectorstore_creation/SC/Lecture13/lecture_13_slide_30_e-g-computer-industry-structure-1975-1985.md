# Slide 30 of Lecture 13 contains information about E.G. Computer Industry Structure 1975 – 1985

This diagram illustrates the dominant "Vertical Integration" model of the computer industry between 1975 and 1985, showcasing the product architecture of major incumbents like IBM, DEC, and the "Bunch" group. The chart lists the entire technological value stack on the left, encompassing physical layers like Microprocessors, Peripherals, and Assembled Hardware, as well as software layers including Operating Systems, Application Software, and Network Services. For each company, a solid vertical bar spans this entire list, labeled "All Products," indicating that these firms operated as monolithic entities that provided every component of the system. In this supply chain context, sourcing and production were highly internalized; a single company controlled the flow from the raw silicon of the microprocessor up to the final user application, contrasting sharply with modern modular supply chains where different vendors specialize in specific horizontal layers.
