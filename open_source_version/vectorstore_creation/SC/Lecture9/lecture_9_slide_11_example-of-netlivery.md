The image is a flowchart depicting various components and processes of an online store system. 

- At the center is a large monitor screen with a green display showing a shopping cart icon labeled “netzlever” and below it is the label “Online Store.” A smartphone with the same display is adjacent to the monitor.

- Above the monitor, a circular green arrow with a price tag icon is labeled “B2B Marketplace Integration.” Above this, logos for “amazon,” “ebay,” “Geizhals,” “CHECK24,” “Rakuten,” and “Google AdWords” are arranged in two rows, indicating possible platforms for integration.

- The monitor connects via a dashed line labeled “ERP” to the right to a green semicircle leading to a box icon labeled “Fulfillment.” This box shows a hand placing a package into it.

- To the right of “Fulfillment,” is a cart icon labeled “Shipping,” connected via dashed line to an intersection with multiple paths:
  - Upward leading to an envelope icon with a euro symbol, labeled “Billing.”
  - Downward leading to a package icon with a green circular arrow, labeled “Returns.”
  - Rightward leading to figures labeled “B2B” (featuring a person in a suit) and “B2C” (featuring a generic person).

- To the left of the monitor, a person icon labeled "Customer" connects downward via a vertical dashed line to the label “Performance Marketing,” which is next to a bar chart icon with an upward arrow.

- Below the monitor is a horizontal dashed line connecting multiple components:
  - A credit card icon labeled “Payment Gateway.”
  - A stack of coins icon labeled “Debtor Management.”
  - A graph icon labeled “KPI - Reporting.”
  - A person with a headset icon labeled “Online Service.”

- A figure labeled “Purchasing” at the top-left is connected via a vertical dashed line to the “Online Store” network.

The entire diagram features a predominantly green and black color scheme, with dotted lines connecting each component to illustrate the flow and process relationships.
