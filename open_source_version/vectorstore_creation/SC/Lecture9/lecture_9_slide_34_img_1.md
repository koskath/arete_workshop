# The image 1 in slide 34 of lecture 9 contains:
The image is a diagram representing a financial flowchart with various components and flows interconnected by lines and arrows.

1. **Top Section:**
   - Three rectangular boxes horizontally aligned.
     - Left box labeled "Capital."
     - Middle box labeled "Long-term loans."
     - Right box labeled "Short-term loans Overdraft."

2. **Center-Left Section:**
   - Below the top section, there is a large rectangular box with wavy horizontal lines inside, labeled with three horizontal arrows pointing outwards, marked as "Dividends," "Tax," and "Interest."

3. **Middle Section:**
   - Three rectangular boxes aligned horizontally, directly below the wavy box with inputs pointing towards them:
     - Left box labeled "Stock."
     - Middle box labeled "Expenses Wages Salaries."
     - Right box labeled "Fixed assets."

4. **Arrows and Lines:**
   - Downward arrows from each of the top three boxes point towards the wavy box.
   - Vertical arrows from the wavy box point downwards toward the horizontal line at the top of the middle three boxes.
   - Diagonal arrows point from the "Capital" and "Long-term loans" boxes towards the rectangle labeled "Stock."
   - A vertical line with arrows on both ends connects "Fixed assets" to the wavy box, implying bidirectional flow.
   - Arrows from the "Stock," "Expenses Wages Salaries," and "Fixed assets" boxes point downward to a circular shape labeled "Manufacture."

5. **Lower Section:**
   - Below "Manufacture," two rectangular boxes:
     - Left box labeled "Work in progress."
     - Right box labeled "Finished stock."
   - Arrows indicate flow from "Manufacture" to "Work in progress," then to "Finished stock."

6. **Right Section:**
   - Two circular shapes connected with lines:
     - Top circle labeled "Debtors," connected with a horizontal line from the wavy box.
     - Bottom circle labeled "Sale," connected with a vertical arrow from "Finished stock" leading upwards.
   - A curved arrow points from "Sale" back to "Debtors."

7. **Profit:**
   - An arrow labeled "Profit margin" points from "Sale" to "Debtors," completing the loop.

All elements are connected with solid lines and arrows indicating the direction of flow, representing the financial process in a cyclical manner.
