# Slide 42 of Lecture 9 contains information about Supply Chain Ratio (SCR) as an Alternative Measure
SCR is a proxy that comprised measures of cash generation and asset efficiency based on readily available financial data from companies published accounts. Increase of SCR comes long with an increase in ROCE and a improvement of CSC measures. This in turn is indicative for good supply chain management practice.
