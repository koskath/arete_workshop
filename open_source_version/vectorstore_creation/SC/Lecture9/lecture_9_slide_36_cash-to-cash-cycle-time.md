Source: Hofmann and Kotzab(2010)

The image is a diagram illustrating the Cash-to-Cash (C2C) cycle for Company 1, with a timeline and various periods marked. The diagram includes the following elements:

1. **Horizontal Axis (Time):**
   - A horizontal arrow labeled "Time" runs across the bottom from left to right.

2. **Key Events on the Timeline:**
   - Four key events labeled as \( t_0 \), \( t_1 \), \( t_2 \), and \( t_3 \) are placed sequentially along the timeline.

3. **Annotations below the Timeline:**
   - Below \( t_0 \): "Inventory purchased by Co. 1 and delivered by vendor Co. x"
   - Below \( t_1 \): "Cash paid by Co. 1"
   - Below \( t_2 \): "Inventory sold to Co. y"
   - Below \( t_3 \): "Cash paid by customer Co. y"

4. **Periods Marked on the Diagram:**
   - An arrow from \( t_0 \) to \( t_1 \) labeled "A/P period (DPO)"
   - An arrow from \( t_1 \) to \( t_2 \) labeled "Inventory period (storage and production time) (DIH)"
   - An arrow from \( t_2 \) to \( t_3 \) labeled "A/R period (DSO)"
   - A large arrow spans from \( t_0 \) to \( t_3 \) labeled "C2C-cycle Company 1"

5. **Vertical Lines:**
   - Vertical lines at \( t_0 \) and \( t_1 \) with double arrows pointing left and right, labeled "supply-side (vendor Co. x)" and "demand-side (customer Co. y)" indicating the flow between the vendor and customer, respectively.

6. **Other Elements:**
   - Annotations above the timeline include "A/P period (DPO)" and "Inventory period (storage and production time) (DIH)" associated with respective arrows.
   - "A/R period (DSO)" is associated with the arrow from \( t_2 \) to \( t_3 \).

The diagram is structured to demonstrate the cycle of inventory and cash flow processes for Company 1, mapped from the purchase of inventory to cash payment by a customer.
