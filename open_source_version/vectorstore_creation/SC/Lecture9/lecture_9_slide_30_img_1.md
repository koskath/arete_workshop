# The image 1 in slide 30 of lecture 9 contains:
The image is a quadrant chart with a horizontal and vertical axis. 

- **Axes:**
  - The horizontal axis at the bottom is labeled "Picking activity" with "Low" on the left and "High" on the right.
  - The vertical axis on the left is labeled "Storage requirement" with "Low" at the bottom and "High" at the top.

- **Quadrants:**
  - **Top Left Quadrant:** Contains the text "High-density storage," "Automated storage," "Goods-to-picker."
  - **Top Right Quadrant:** Contains the text "High-density storage," "Automated storage & handling," "Goods-to-picker / automated (or dynamic pick face)."
  - **Bottom Left Quadrant:** Contains the text "Low-density storage," "Manual storage & handling," "Picker-to-goods."
  - **Bottom Right Quadrant:** Contains the text "Low-density storage," "Automated handling," "Picker-to-goods (or automated picking)."

- **Diagonal Arrow:**
  - A diagonal arrow runs from the bottom left to the top right.
  - Alongside the arrow is the text "Increasing storage focus" at the top and "Increasing picking focus" at the bottom.

The quadrants are divided by two perpendicular lines creating a four-part grid. The text is evenly distributed within each quadrant, and the arrow with labels emphasizes a gradient from one type of focus to another along the chart diagonal.
