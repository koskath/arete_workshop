# Slide 14 of Lecture 9 contains information about Typical Warehouse Layouts

The slide consists of three diagrams representing different warehouse operation flows: a straight flow operation, a 'U' flow operation with conveyors, and an 'L' flow operation with a conveyor. Each diagram is labeled and structured distinctly with annotations for directions and actions.

1. **Straight Flow Operation (Left Diagram):**
   - A rectangular area with "Picking face" labeled horizontally near the top.
   - Below "Picking face," there are three horizontal rows of rectangles.
     - Top row: Three rectangles labeled "A".
     - Middle row: Three rectangles labeled "A".
     - Bottom row: Three rectangles labeled "B".
     - Fourth and final row at the bottom with three rectangles labeled "C".
   - Arrows indicate flows:
     - Three upward arrows from the bottom labeled "Goods receipt" pointing toward the rectangles.
     - Arrows continue upward through the rows toward "Picking face".
     - Multiple upward arrows above "Picking face," labeled "Shipping".

2. **'U' Flow Operation with Conveyors (Middle Diagram):**
   - Two vertical columns of rectangles, each labeled with a different "Location" number:
     - Left column, top to bottom: "Location 4," "Location 3," "Location 2," "Location 1".
     - Right column, top to bottom: "Location 8," "Location 7," "Location 6," "Location 5".
   - Arrows denote flow:
     - Vertical downward arrows from "Goods receipt" at top down to "Location 8" and "Location 4".
     - Horizontal arrows within and between the rows.
     - Vertical arrows down the right side to the "Order assembly" at the bottom.
     - Arrows indicate a U-shaped path of flow with shipping indicated at the top again.

3. **'L' Flow Operation with Conveyor (Right Diagram):**
   - A rectangular area with two columns of boxes.
     - Left column from top to bottom: "A", "B", "C".
     - Right column from top to bottom: Three "A" boxes, three "B" boxes, three "C" boxes.
   - Arrows denote flow:
     - Two rightward arrows labeled "Goods receipt" at top/right.
     - Downward arrows moving through each column toward "Picking face", extending horizontally.
     - A bottom horizontal conveyor indicated by a shaded path with an arrow, cycling flow back toward the top.
     - The overall flow shape is an "L", with shipping arrows at the rightmost end.

Each diagram is accompanied with a descriptive label at the bottom: "A straight flow operation," "A ‘U’ flow operation with conveyors," and "An ‘L’ flow operation with conveyor," respectively.
