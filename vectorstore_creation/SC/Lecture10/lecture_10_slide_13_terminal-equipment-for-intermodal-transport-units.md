# Slide 13 of Lecture 10 contains information about Terminal Equipment for Intermodal Transport Units

**Straddle Carrier**  
Circulate over container piles. Can go over stacks up to 3 in height. Density of 500 to 700 TEU per hectare.  

**Rubber-tired Gantry**  
High storage densities (1,000 TEU per hectare). Difficult to move from one stack to the other. High acquisition but low operating costs.  

**Front-end Loader**  
Use container top anchor points. Handle most containers. Can reach stacks up to 3 in height.  

**Rail-mounted Gantry**  
Highest storage density (widespan: +1,000 TEU per hectare); mostly used at port terminals. Lowest operating costs. Fixed to rail tracks.  

**Reach Stacker**  
Flexible side loaders. Can reach stacks up to 3 full or 5 empty containers in height. 500 TEU per hectare.  

**Portainer**  
Load and unload containerships. Various sizes (Panamax and Super-Panamax).
