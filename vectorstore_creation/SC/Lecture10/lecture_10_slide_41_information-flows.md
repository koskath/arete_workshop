# Slide 41 of Lecture 10 contains information about Information Flows – Description of the Slide

This slide illustrates the complexity of **information flows** in a multimodal logistics chain, highlighting how many actors must coordinate to move a single shipment successfully. At the center of the diagram is the **Freight Forwarder (Jessica)**, who acts as the key orchestrator. The red annotations emphasize the confusion, questions, and the overwhelming number of interactions she must handle.
On the left side, the **Exporter/Shipper** and the **Trucker** rely heavily on the forwarder for instructions, documentation, pickup arrangements, and timing. They depend on Jessica to communicate booking confirmations, container availability, shipping schedules, customs requirements, and loading instructions.
Further along the chain, the shipment may move through an **Inland Container Depot**, **Railway Terminal**, and **Railway Operator**. Each of these actors needs precise information: when the container will arrive, whether it’s empty or full, what documents accompany it, and which onward transport leg is booked. Miscommunication at any of these nodes can cause delays, extra costs, or even shipment failure.
At the end of the chain, the **Ocean Carrier** and the **Terminal/Container Depot at the Seaport** require timely data on container status, booking numbers, cut-off times, and dangerous goods declarations. They also feed information back to the freight forwarder, who must relay updates to all other parties.
The red markings—circles, arrows, question marks—symbolize the **information chaos** typical of traditional, non-digitalized supply chains. They show that the freight forwarder becomes the bottleneck but also the glue holding the chain together. This visual reinforces the lecture’s point: in logistics, **information flows are just as critical as physical flows**, and managing them effectively is essential for reliability, synchronization, and cost efficiency.
