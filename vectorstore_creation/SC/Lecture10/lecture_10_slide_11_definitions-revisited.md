# Slide 11 of Lecture 10 contains information about Definitions Revisited
# The diagram in slide 11 of lecture 10 illustrates the conceptual relationship between **Multimodal Transport**, **Intermodal Transport**, and **Combined Transport** using three nested rectangles.  
Handwritten annotations indicate examples of transport modes and load units associated with each layer.

---

## 1. Outer Rectangle – Multimodal Transport
- This is the **largest box**, representing the broadest category.
- **Multimodal transport** refers to the use of *two or more* different modes of transport under a *single transport contract*.
- Written at the top of the rectangle: **“AIR”** (left) and **“SEA”** (right), indicating typical modes involved.
- At the bottom left, the handwritten terms **“ULD”** (Unit Load Device) and **“BUP”** (Built-Up Pallet) are shown, representing air-cargo loading units.

*Interpretation:* Multimodal transport includes any combination of transport modes and load units, including air, sea, road, and rail.

---

## 2. Middle Rectangle – Intermodal Transport
- A smaller rectangle sits inside the multimodal one.
- **Intermodal transport** specifically refers to using multiple modes while keeping the **same loading unit** (e.g., container, ULD) for the entire journey.
- The handwritten word **“INTERMODAL”** appears in red across this rectangle.

*Interpretation:* All intermodal transport is multimodal, but not all multimodal transport is intermodal.

---

## 3. Inner Rectangle – Combined Transport
- The smallest rectangle represents **combined transport**, a subset of intermodal transport.
- The handwritten label **“COMBINED”** is placed inside.
- Combined transport typically means:
  - The **main haul** is by **rail or inland waterways**,  
  - **Pre- and post-haulage** is by **road**.

*Interpretation:* Combined transport is the most specific category—focused on environmentally friendly, intermodal solutions where long-distance segments avoid road transport.

## 4. Additional Annotations
- At the bottom right, written in red: **“FCL”** (Full Container Load) and **“LCL”** (Less-than-Container Load).
  - These terms relate to containerization and are relevant to intermodal and combined transport.

---

## Overall Interpretation
- The nesting illustrates a **hierarchy of specificity**:
  - **Multimodal** (broadest)
    - contains **Intermodal** (more specific: same loading unit)
      - contains **Combined Transport** (most specific: environmentally optimized mode split)
- The handwritten notes connect each layer to relevant **transport modes**, **loading units**, and **shipment types** used in practice.
