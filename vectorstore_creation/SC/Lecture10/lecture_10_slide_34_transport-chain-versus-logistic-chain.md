# Slide 34 of Lecture 10 contains information about Transport Chain versus Logistic Chain

"A transport chain is a sequence of technical and organizational processes tied together, where persons or goods are moved from a source to an end. The transport chain has to be regarded as system.[...] The organizational connection is reached by coordination of information and control systems for legal and commercial issues. The transport chain as a system holds close relationships to other neighbouring systems like manufacturing and consumption of goods."
