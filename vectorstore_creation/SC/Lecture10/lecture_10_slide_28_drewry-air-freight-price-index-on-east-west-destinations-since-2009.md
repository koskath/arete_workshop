# Slide 28 of Lecture 10 contains information about Drewry Air Freight Price Index: on East-West Destinations since 2009

This slide presents the Drewry Air Freight Price Index for East-West destinations spanning from September 2009 through late 2024, measured in US dollars per kilogram. The visualization combines vertical blue bars representing individual data points with a red trend line that smooths the underlying price movements over this extended period.
The chart opens in September 2009 with rates around 5.00 to 6.00 USD per kilogram, showing considerable week-to-week volatility as evidenced by the fluctuating bar heights. Throughout the initial years from 2009 through approximately 2013, the red trend line demonstrates a gradual declining trajectory, moving from the 5.00 USD range down toward 4.00 USD per kilogram. This downward pressure likely reflects the post-financial crisis period when global trade volumes were recovering and air freight capacity was being rebalanced with demand.
From 2013 through 2019, the market entered a period of relative stability with the trend line hovering in a narrow band between approximately 2.50 and 3.00 USD per kilogram. This extended phase represents what could be considered normalized market conditions for air freight on East-West routes. The individual weekly bars continue to show variability around the trend line, reflecting typical seasonal patterns, fuel price fluctuations, and short-term supply-demand imbalances that characterize air cargo markets.
A dramatic shift occurred beginning in late 2019 and accelerating through 2020 and 2021. The trend line begins climbing sharply, and the weekly price bars show increasingly extreme spikes. Rates surge past 6.00 USD per kilogram and reach peaks exceeding 7.00 USD per kilogram, with the highest point around 7.30 USD appearing in what seems to be late 2021 or early 2022. This period, circled and annotated with "2x" on the chart, indicates that rates approximately doubled compared to the pre-pandemic baseline. The extreme volatility during this timeframe reflects the unprecedented disruptions to global air freight capacity as passenger aircraft belly cargo disappeared from the market, e-commerce demand surged, and supply chain pressures intensified across all modes of transportation.
Following the peak in late 2021 and early 2022, the trend line shows a sustained decline through 2022 and into 2023. However, unlike the rail freight data that returned closer to historical norms, air freight rates appear to have stabilized at a level somewhat elevated compared to the 2013-2019 baseline. The trend line settles in the 4.00 USD per kilogram range through much of 2023 and into 2024, suggesting a new equilibrium that is higher than pre-pandemic levels but well below the crisis peaks.
The most recent data highlighted on the chart indicates that as of January 2025, the rate stands at 3.23 USD per kilogram. This represents a continued downward trend from the elevated 2023-2024 levels, moving closer to but still somewhat above the pre-pandemic baseline of 2.50 to 3.00 USD per kilogram. The annotation with a downward arrow on the right side of the chart emphasizes this recent declining trajectory.
Throughout the entire time series, the persistent week-to-week volatility shown by the individual bars illustrates the inherently dynamic nature of air freight pricing. Unlike ocean or rail freight which typically operates on contract rates with longer commitment periods, air freight markets adjust rapidly to capacity changes, fuel costs, seasonal demand patterns, and spot market conditions.
