# Slide 26 of Lecture 10 contains information about Further Development of Eurasian Railway - ERAI U-West

This slide tracks the development of Eurasian Railway freight rates from July 2016 through January 2025, displaying multiple route pricing indicators measured in US dollars per forty-foot equivalent unit. The data shows six different rate series including the ERAI Composite index, ERAI U-East and U-West routes, Shanghai to Rotterdam rates in both directions, and TAC Hong Kong to Europe per ton rates.
The visualization reveals several distinct periods of market behavior. From mid-2016 through early 2020, rates remained relatively stable across all measured routes, clustering between approximately 2,000 and 4,000 USD per FEU. This period, circled in red on the chart with a notation of "2016", represents the baseline operational environment for Eurasian rail freight before major disruptions occurred.
The stability was dramatically interrupted beginning in late 2020 and extending through 2021 and into early 2022. The Shanghai to Rotterdam route, represented by the dark blue line, experienced the most extreme volatility, spiking to over 15,000 USD per FEU at its peak. The TAC Hong Kong to Europe rates shown in light blue also surged significantly, reaching approximately 8,000 USD per FEU. These sharp increases coincided with global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic period when ocean freight capacity constraints and port congestion drove shippers to seek alternative routing options through rail corridors.
Following the peaks in 2021 and early 2022, rates began a sustained decline back toward historical norms. By late 2022 and into 2023, most routes had returned to the 2,000 to 3,000 USD per FEU range. However, another period of volatility emerged in 2024, circled in red on the right side of the chart, where the Shanghai to Rotterdam rates again climbed to around 9,000 USD per FEU before declining and then experiencing renewed upward pressure.
The most recent data point highlighted on the chart indicates that as of January 2025, rates stand at 3,373 USD per FEU, suggesting a return to more normalized market conditions compared to the extreme volatility of previous years. The ERAI Composite and directional indices have remained relatively flat throughout the entire period shown, maintaining their positions in the 2,500 to 3,000 USD per FEU range with minimal deviation.
From a supply chain analytics perspective, this chart illustrates several critical concepts. The dramatic rate volatility demonstrates the intermodal competition and substitution effects between ocean and rail freight, where capacity constraints in one mode drive demand and pricing in alternative modes. The differential behavior between composite indices and specific lane rates shows how aggregated market indicators can mask significant route-level volatility. The cyclical pattern of disruption, recovery, normalization, and renewed disruption reflects the complex interplay of geopolitical events, infrastructure capacity, demand fluctuations, and competitive dynamics in transcontinental freight markets. Understanding these patterns is essential for freight procurement strategy, modal selection decisions, and supply chain risk management in global logistics operations.
