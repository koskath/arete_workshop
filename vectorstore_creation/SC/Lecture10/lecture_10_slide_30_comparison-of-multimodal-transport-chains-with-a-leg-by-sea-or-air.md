# Slide 30 of Lecture 10 contains information about Comparison of Multimodal Transport Chains with a Leg by Sea or Air

This slide provides a systematic comparison of multimodal transport chains that include either a sea leg or an air leg as the main haul segment, drawing from a stylized model framework developed by Schramm in 2012 with updates. The comparison examines eleven different dimensions of these transport modes to highlight their operational, organizational, and legal differences.
The transport mode distinction establishes the fundamental difference, with sea freight utilizing main haul by sea while air freight employs main haul by air. This primary modal choice cascades into numerous other operational differences throughout the transport chain. The carrier on the main haul for sea freight is a shipping company operating vessels, while for air freight it is an airline operating aircraft. This difference in carrier type reflects fundamentally different business models, asset structures, and operational constraints between maritime and aviation industries.
Regarding organizational forms for pre-carriage and onward-carriage segments, sea freight typically employs either carrier haulage where the shipping line arranges the inland transportation or merchant haulage where the shipper or consignee arranges it. Air freight uses either airline trucking where the airline controls the ground transportation or agent trucking where a freight forwarder or agent manages it. These arrangements determine who has responsibility and liability for the door-to-door movement beyond the main haul segment.
The points of transshipment differ significantly between modes. Sea freight uses container terminals at seaports, which are large-scale facilities designed to handle high volumes of standardized containers with specialized cranes and yard equipment. Air freight operates through cargo terminals at airports, which are configured differently to accommodate the time-sensitive nature of air cargo and the different unit load devices used in aviation. These terminals require different equipment, layouts, and operational procedures suited to their respective modes.
The main actor at transshipment points is the terminal operator for sea freight, typically a specialized company that may handle containers for multiple shipping lines at a shared facility. For air freight, the groundhandler performs this role, often providing services for multiple airlines and managing the interface between aircraft and ground transportation. These entities have different equipment, labor requirements, and operational tempos reflecting the different handling characteristics of their cargo.
Types of transport brokers also vary between modes. Sea freight employs loading brokers who arrange space on vessels, discharging brokers who coordinate receiving cargo at destination ports, or non-vessel operators who consolidate smaller shipments. Air freight uses air freight brokers or non-vessel operators who perform similar consolidation and booking functions but within the aviation ecosystem. The distinction reflects the different market structures and intermediary roles that have evolved in each industry.
Transport agents represent the sales and operational arms of carriers in foreign markets. Sea freight utilizes shipping or liner agents who represent vessel operators in ports worldwide, handling documentation, coordinating port calls, and managing local relationships. Air freight employs IATA cargo sales agents, which are accredited entities authorized to sell air cargo capacity on behalf of airlines. The IATA accreditation system provides standardization and financial safeguards specific to the aviation industry.
Unit loads differ fundamentally between modes. Sea freight predominantly uses seagoing containers, which are standardized in sizes of twenty-foot and forty-foot equivalent units designed to withstand the rigors of ocean transport and facilitate intermodal transfers between ships, trucks, and rail. Air freight uses unit load devices, which are lightweight aluminum or composite containers and pallets specifically designed to fit aircraft cargo holds and maximize utilization of available space while minimizing weight. These different unit load systems reflect the distinct engineering and economic constraints of each mode.
The legal regimes governing liability and carrier obligations differ substantially. Sea freight operates under the Hague Rules, Visby Rules, or Hamburg Rules depending on the trade lane and parties involved. These conventions establish carrier liability limits, define the responsibilities of shippers and carriers, and provide frameworks for resolving disputes arising from maritime transport. Air freight is governed by the Warsaw Convention or Montreal Convention and IATA Resolution 600a, which establish different liability frameworks specific to international air carriage with different limits and conditions than maritime law.
The accompanying transport document serves as evidence of the contract of carriage, receipt for the goods, and in some cases document of title. Sea freight uses the Bill of Lading, which can be a negotiable document of title allowing the transfer of ownership through endorsement, or a seaway bill, which is a non-negotiable transport document. Air freight employs the air waybill, which is always a non-negotiable document that cannot be used to transfer title to goods. This distinction has significant implications for trade finance, payment terms, and the ability to trade goods while in transit.
Finally, the applicable trade terms according to Incoterms 2020 show both commonalities and differences. Both modes can use EXW where the seller makes goods available at their premises, FCA where the seller delivers to a carrier nominated by the buyer, CIP where the seller pays for carriage and insurance to destination, CPT where the seller pays carriage to destination, DAP where the seller delivers at a named place, and DPU where the seller delivers and unloads at destination. However, sea freight has additional specific terms including FAS for delivery alongside the vessel, FOB for delivery on board the vessel, CFR for cost and freight to destination port, CIF for cost insurance and freight to destination port, and DDP for delivered duty paid. The availability of these additional maritime-specific terms reflects the historical development of international trade law around ocean shipping and the continued predominance of sea freight in global trade volumes.
