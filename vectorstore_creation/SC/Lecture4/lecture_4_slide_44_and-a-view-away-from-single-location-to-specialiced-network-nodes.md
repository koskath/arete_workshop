# Slide 44 of Lecture 4 contains information about And a view away from single location to specialiced network nodes

# The diagram in slide 44 of lecture 4 presents a geographic representation of a specialized production network distributed across Europe and North Africa. A legend on the left identifies four facility types: Assembly plant (represented by a blue L-shaped symbol), Components (shown as a small blue square), Integrated plants (depicted as a blue L-shaped symbol with a circular highlight), and Suppliers (indicated by a small open square).

The map displays numerous facilities strategically positioned across the geographic region. Multiple integrated plants are shown with circular highlights around them, indicating their significance as major network hubs. These integrated facilities appear clustered in several regions, particularly in central and western Europe. Assembly plants are distributed across various locations throughout the network. Component facilities are scattered across the map, positioned near both assembly and integrated plants. Supplier locations are indicated at various points across the region.

White lines connect various facilities across the network, illustrating the material and information flows between nodes. These connection lines demonstrate the interdependencies within the production system, linking suppliers to component facilities, components to assembly operations, and various combinations of these facility types.

Red text overlaid on the map emphasizes the strategic concept: "...building on whole systems of nodes and links." This annotation highlights the fundamental principle that the network operates as an interconnected system rather than isolated locations, with each node serving a specialized function within the broader production ecosystem. The geographic distribution demonstrates how manufacturing operations can be dispersed across multiple countries while maintaining integration through systematic linkages.
