# The diagram in slide 35 of lecture 4 presents a comprehensive framework illustrating how global production networks create synergy through strategic configuration. The model is structured with two main input components at the top, a central synergistic mechanism, and three configuration mechanisms at the bottom.

At the top left, the EXTERNAL DRIVERS box identifies key environmental factors including Supply vs. demand dynamics and Global vs. local considerations. At the top right, the SYNERGISTIC OUTCOMES box lists the benefits achieved: Cost, Growth, Resource access, Innovation and learning, and Flexibility and resilience.

These two components are connected by a bidirectional horizontal arrow labeled "Performance objectives aligned with external drivers and competitive positioning," indicating the alignment between external pressures and desired outcomes.

Both top boxes connect via diagonal arrows to the central concept: SYNERGY FROM CONFIGURATION OF GLOBAL PRODUCTION NETWORKS. The left arrow descending from External Drivers is labeled "Operations strategy aligned with opportunities in the external environment," showing how external factors inform strategic decisions. The right arrow ascending from the center to Synergistic Outcomes is labeled "Strategic configuration leading to differentiated performance," demonstrating how network configuration drives competitive advantages.

Below the central synergy concept, three configuration mechanisms are presented in dashed boxes within a larger CONFIGURATION MECHANISMS container:

The left box contains Inter-Firm Specialisation with elements of Make, Partnerships, Buy, and Supplier development, representing decisions about external relationships and value chain boundaries.

The center box presents Intra-Firm Specialisation including Product/process scope, Location logic, Plant configuration, and Network role, addressing internal organizational structure and facility management.

The right box shows Global-Local Balancing encompassing Product portfolio, Production processes, and Business processes, representing the strategic trade-offs between standardization and local adaptation.

These three mechanisms collectively determine how organizations configure their global production networks to achieve the synergistic outcomes while responding to external drivers.
