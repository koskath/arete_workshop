# Slide 7 of Lecture 4 contains information about Henry Fords Assembly Line Perfectioning scientific management.
Henry Ford’s assembly line transformed automobile production in the early twentieth century. By 1918, half of all cars in America were Model Ts. To meet the growing demand for the Model T, the company opened a large factory at Highland Park, Michigan, in 1910. Here, Henry Ford combined precision manufacturing, standardized and interchangeable parts, a division of labor and, in 1913, a continuous moving assembly line. Workers remained in place, adding one component to each automobile as it moved past them on the line, while the delivery of parts by conveyor belt to the workers was carefully timed to keep the assembly line moving smoothly and efficiently. The introduction of the moving assembly line revolutionized automobile production by significantly reducing assembly time per vehicle and thus lowering costs. As a result, Ford's production of Model Ts made his company the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Session 4 - Production and Global Production Networks Slide 7.
