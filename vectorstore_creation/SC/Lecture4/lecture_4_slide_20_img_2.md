# The image 2 in slide 20 of lecture 4 contains:
The image depicts a warehouse or storage area with multiple items organized on wooden pallets. In the foreground, there is a partially open cardboard box, revealing its flaps. The box is situated on a wooden pallet and has visible markings or letters on it, one of which is "BMV."

To the right of the box, there are several green metal crates placed on pallets. These containers are filled with various metal components. The frontmost crate appears to hold multiple circular or disc-like objects. Behind them is another crate containing more metal objects wrapped in transparent plastic.

Further into the background, there are more green metal crates, some stacked with flat, rectangular metal sheets or components. On the far left, a stack of angled metal pieces is placed next to a sheet of paper, possibly containing item details or inventory information.

The floor appears to be a smooth, industrial surface, with a visible line running parallel to the crates and boxes. The overall arrangement suggests an organized storage or inventory area for metal parts or components used in manufacturing or assembly.
