# Slide 4 of Lecture 4 contains information about Taylors „Art and Science of Shoveling“

# The image 1 in slide 4 of lecture 4 contains a detailed chart titled "The Art and Science of Shoveling." It features a central line graph, illustrations of shovels, and annotations.

### Line Graph
- **Axes**: 
  - The horizontal axis is labeled "Shovel Load in pounds," marked at intervals from 5 to 40.
  - The vertical axis on the left is labeled in pounds, ranging from 20 to 60. The labels include: 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 48, 50, 55, 60.

- **Graph Line**: 
  - Starts at approximately 10 pounds on the vertical axis when the horizontal axis is at 40 pounds.
  - Rises to a peak near 24 pounds on the vertical axis when the horizontal axis is roughly 21.5 pounds.
  - Declines back to the initial level as it approaches 5 pounds on the horizontal axis.

### Annotations
- **Above the Graph**:
  - "The Art and Science of Shoveling" is written prominently at the top center.
  - A section listing numerical data:
    - "Number of laborers" with specifics "Old way"—500 and "New way"—1400.
    - "Cost per man per day" as "Old way"—16c and "New way"—9c.
    - "Earnings per man per day" — "Old way"—1.15s and "New way"—1.88s.
    - "Cost per ton" — "Old way"—0.072 and "New way"—0.033.
  - A note on the graph itself reads, "21 ½ lbs optimum shovel load for any material."

- **Right Side**:
  - Illustrations of five shovels showing different designs. 
  - A caption states, "The correspondent different kinds of shovels."

### Caption at the Bottom

The diagram is enclosed in a rectangular border with clear labels and annotations that guide the viewer's understanding of the data presented.

# The image 2 in slide 4 of lecture 4 is an advertisement for the "Wyoming 21-Pound Load Shovel.":

Starting at the top, the headline reads, "Give Him a 21-Pound Load Shovel," followed by the subheading, "He'll Double your Results." Below this is a descriptive text: "The Wyoming 21-Pound Load shovel is a shovel which is designed to hold an average of 21 pounds a load."

To the right is an illustration of a worker in a cap, long-sleeved shirt, pants, and boots. He is holding a shovel tilted downward, appears to be mid-stride, and facing left. The background includes indistinct shapes suggestive of an industrial setting, with architectural elements sketched behind him.

Next to this illustration, the ad mentions "Frederick W. Taylor—the man who first made 'scientific management' popular—demonstrates beyond doubt that this shovel does his workers' larger work when his average is 21 pounds."

Further down, the text continues, detailing Taylor’s experiments with Wyoming Shovels and inviting customers to "cash in on his discovery by adopting" these shovels. There is a prominent label, "WYOMING '21 POUND LOAD' SHOVELS," centered within a rectangular frame. 

The smaller print in the lower portion discusses Taylor's specific experiments and findings regarding shovel loads and efficiency, referencing the Bethlehem Steel Works and describing the productivity improvements achieved.

Centered towards the bottom is a call-to-action section, titled in quotes as "'Scientific Shoveling' Send for a Copy," promoting the availability of illustrative material. Below this is the contact information: "The Wyoming Shovel Works, Wyoming, Penna."

On the lower right, there is an additional inset with a block labeled "SCIENTIFIC SHOVELING" and a simple graphic resembling a shovel blade with the word "WYOMING" beneath it.
