# Slide 21 of Lecture 4 contains information about Lean - A Strategy Based on Lead Time Compression

# The diagram in slide 21 of lecture 4 presents a visual representation of value-added activities versus waste in a production process.
The horizontal timeline is divided into alternating segments positioned above and below a central black baseline.

Green rectangular segments extend upward from the baseline, labeled as Adding Value. These value-adding segments appear at six different intervals across the timeline, varying in width. The green bars represent activities that directly contribute to product transformation or customer value creation.

Red rectangular segments extend downward from the baseline, labeled as Waste. These waste segments occupy five intervals between and around the value-adding activities, also varying in width. The red bars represent non-value-adding time including waiting, transportation, inspection, or other forms of waste in the process.

A horizontal orange arrow spans the entire width of the diagram at the bottom, labeled as Total Time. This arrow indicates that the complete process duration encompasses both the value-adding green segments and the waste red segments combined.

The visual structure demonstrates that waste activities consume a significant portion of the total lead time, with the red segments appearing to occupy more cumulative space than the green value-adding segments. This representation illustrates the lean manufacturing principle that reducing or eliminating waste provides opportunity for lead time compression while maintaining the essential value-adding activities.


A strategic focus to economically make drastic reductions in lead time to better serve the customer. Think No Cost/Low Cost.
