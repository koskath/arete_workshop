# Slide 18 of Lecture 4 contains information about The image in slide 18 of lecture 4 depicts a line drawing showing an NC (Numerical Control) machine and a human figure.
The NC machine is on the left and has a rectangular shape with a rounded top. The front panel displays a circular element at the top, labeled "NC-Maschine." Below the label are multiple control buttons or indicators, depicted as small dark rectangles. An angular structure extends from the front of the machine, suggesting a material processing area, with visible horizontal and vertical lines and a part being processed.

To the left of the machine, there are two cubic boxes. The boxes have visible top surfaces and are placed slightly apart from each other.

On the right side, a human figure is standing, facing the machine. The figure is wearing a cap, a jacket, pants, and shoes. The figure's hands are hanging at the sides, and its facial features are minimal, with a slight outline for the nose and mouth.

An arrowed line extends from the right side of the human figure toward a point on the machine front panel, indicating an interaction or a point of interest. The scene is simplified, with minimal detail suggesting a controlled or manufacturing environment.
