# The image 1 in slide 24 of lecture 9 contains:
The image shows three separate, rectangular, block-like structures arranged in a staggered formation. Each structure is composed of smaller, individual rectangular units that are stacked together in a grid pattern. The structures are aligned with each other from left to right, with slight variations in depth.

1. **Left Structure:**
   - Consists of four horizontal rows and three vertical columns of smaller rectangles, creating a grid of 12 rectangles.
   - Each rectangle is outlined distinctly.
   - The front face features vertical, crisscrossing dark bars resembling a lattice or support framework.

2. **Middle Structure:**
   - Similar layout to the left structure with four horizontal rows and three vertical columns.
   - Positioned slightly behind the left structure.
   - Displays the same crisscrossing dark bars on the front face.

3. **Right Structure:**
   - Identical configuration of four rows and three columns of smaller rectangles, like the other two structures.
   - Placed behind and slightly to the right of the middle structure.
   - Front face also has the dark, lattice-like bars.

All three structures are depicted in an isometric perspective, giving a sense of depth and three-dimensionality. The lighter shaded rectangles contrast with the darker lattice elements, highlighting the structural support on the front faces. There are no visible annotations, labels, or other elements within the image.
