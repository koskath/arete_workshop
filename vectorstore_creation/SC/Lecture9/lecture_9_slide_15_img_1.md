# The image 1 in slide 15 of lecture 9 contains:
The image depicts a schematic diagram of a warehouse layout with various components and marked paths. 

- The diagram is enclosed in a rectangular outline representing the warehouse.
- At the top, centered text reads "Wareneingang" to indicate the goods entrance, and "Warenausgang" at the bottom for goods exit.
- On the left side, two adjacent rectangles resembling trucks or loading docks are present, with open sections pointing towards the warehouse.
- Inside, there are two labeled areas with a grid-like pattern of small squares representing stored goods. 
  - The top left has two stacked grid blocks.
  - There is a continuous grid strip above the entrance into the central warehouse area.
- The warehouse interior contains several parallel rectangular blocks arranged horizontally, placed in rows from top to bottom:
  1. The top row contains eight sections, each with smaller boxes/leaving spaces to indicate subdivisions within each section.
  2. The middle row similarly has eight sections, with similar subdivisions.
  3. An additional, smaller section is shown just below the middle row on the right, depicted with a thick line around it.
  4. Another section is at the bottom as part of a looped path system within the lower half of the warehouse.
- Arrows throughout the diagram depict movement direction within the warehouse:
  - From the goods entrance, arrows point right into the central warehouse, with paths leading to the top storage row.
  - Vertical arrows go from the top storage row to the middle storage row.
  - Arrows continue downward from the middle row towards the exit on the right side.
  - Further arrows illustrate a loop from the central sections back toward the exit path on the right side, suggesting a flow from entrance to exit.
- A small grid square in the middle division, connected by arrows, hints at a transfer or holding point.
- Overall, the layout shows a systematic flow of materials from left to right, then downwards, following the arrows indicated through storage, processing, and eventual exit from the warehouse.
