This infographic maps the current global manufacturing footprint of the LEGO Group, illustrating a decentralized supply chain strategy where production facilities are located on three continents to remain close to key markets. The network currently consists of five operational manufacturing sites with a sixth under construction. In the European region, the supply chain is segmented: the historic facility in Billund, Denmark, employs 700 people focusing specifically on moulding, while a major hub in Kladno, Czech Republic, utilizes 4,500 employees for processing and packing. A third European site in Nyíregyháza, Hungary, acts as a comprehensive facility handling moulding, processing, and packing with 3,100 staff; together, these three sites supply Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The Americas are served by a single, integrated facility in Monterrey, Mexico, where 3,500 employees handle the full production cycle. Similarly, the Asian market is currently supplied by a facility in Jiaxing, China, which employs 1,200 people for moulding through packing.

The visual also provides detailed information on future expansion, highlighting a new factory in Vietnam scheduled to open in the first half of 2024 to further support growth in Asia. This project represents a $1 billion investment over 15 years and is designed to be the company's first carbon-neutral factory, featuring onsite solar panels and a commitment to meeting 100% of requirements with renewable energy. The timeline outlines a construction start in late 2022 and team recruitment in late 2023, with the goal of eventually employing 4,000 colleagues for moulding and packing operations.
