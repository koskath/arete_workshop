# Slide 7 of Lecture 9 contains information about Example of LEGO

This slide provides a comprehensive overview of global logistics strategies, moving from theoretical frameworks of outbound distribution to a real-world case study of supply chain network redesign. The first section categorizes international logistics into four distinct systems based on where inventory is held relative to the home firm and the consumer. The "Classic Distribution System" represents a high-touch model where goods pass through a central warehouse in the home country and a regional warehouse abroad before reaching the consumer. "Transit Systems" offer a leaner approach by eliminating one of these storage nodes, either shipping directly from a domestic central warehouse to the foreign consumer or bypassing domestic storage to ship directly to a foreign regional warehouse. The "Multi-Country-Systems" introduce a consolidated hub in a "Third Country," using a central warehouse in a neutral location to feed either regional warehouses or consumers directly, while the "Direct Delivery" model shows the most streamlined flow with the home firm shipping straight to the consumer with no intermediate nodes.

The second section illustrates the practical application of these concepts through the transformation of LEGO’s distribution network between 2004 and 2007. Initially, the company operated a highly fragmented "Complex 3-level Distribution Structure," where manufacturing sites in Denmark, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic fed into a multi-tiered hierarchy of warehouses. This included Level 1 Central DCs in Denmark and Switzerland, Level 2 Central Warehouses in Germany, and a dense network of Level 3 Regional DCs scattered across France, Germany, and Denmark to serve specific European markets. By 2007, the company drastically consolidated this into a "Simplified Distribution Structure." The manufacturing footprint shifted to include Hungary, but the logistics network was flattened into a single major hub, the "EDC Jirny," which appears to be an outsourced facility based on the chart's legend. This central node now receives goods from all manufacturing origins and distributes directly to European customers and overseas centers, eliminating the previous three layers of handling. This successful shift from a multi-echelon network to a centralized, streamlined model resulted in the company winning the European Supply Chain Excellence Award in 2008 in the Logistics and Fulfilment category.
