# Slide 31 of Lecture 9 contains information about Work Organization and Job Design
Automation and computerisation are reducing human intervention in the physical handling of freight and increasing information interaction, which has important implications for job design. Socio‑Technical System Theory (STS) focuses on the impact of implementing warehouse technologies on the workforce. The fundamental principles of STS theory are the joint optimisation of the technical and social system, a focus on quality of work life, employee participation in system design and the use of semi‑autonomous work groups.
