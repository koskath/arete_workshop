The learning objectives are to define the role of warehousing in global supply chains, to gain insights into how warehouses are managed and how they add value to supply chains, and to explain how material handling, storage and order picking are organised and executed. Furthermore, you should be able to summarise inventory management techniques and metrics and demonstrate the importance of logistics or supply chain performance metrics in both a single‑company and a broader supply chain context. 3
