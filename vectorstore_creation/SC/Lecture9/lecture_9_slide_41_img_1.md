# The image 1 in slide 41 of lecture 9 contains:
The image is a timeline diagram titled "The 'SwissPostLogistics'-case," illustrating the cash-to-cash (C2C) cycle and various time periods associated with Procter & Gamble (P&G), SwissPostLogistics (SPL), and Retailer.

1. **Horizontal Axis:**
   - The axis at the bottom represents "Time" moving from left to right, marked with six time points: \( t_0, t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, t_5, t_6 \).

2. **Vertical Lines:**
   - **\( t_0 \)**: Inventory purchased by P&G.
   - **\( t_1 \)**: Cash paid by P&G.
   - **\( t_2 \)**: Inventory sold to SPL.
   - **\( t_3 \)**: Cash paid by SPL.
   - **\( t_4 \)**: Inventory sold to Retailer.
   - **\( t_5 \)**: Cash paid by Retailer.
   - **\( t_6 \)**: Goods sold/cash paid by End-consumer at point of sale.

3. **Arrows and Annotations:**
   - Between \( t_0 \) and \( t_2 \), a leftward arrow is labeled "Inventory period P&G."
   - Between \( t_0 \) and \( t_1 \), a leftward arrow is labeled "A/P period P&G."
   - Between \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \), a rightward arrow is labeled "A/R period P&G."
   - Between \( t_2 \) and \( t_4 \), a leftward dashed arrow is labeled "Inventory period SPL."
   - Between \( t_2 \) and \( t_3 \), a rightward arrow is labeled "A/R period SPL."
   - Between \( t_3 \) and \( t_4 \), a leftward arrow is labeled "A/P period SPL."
   - Between \( t_4 \) and \( t_6 \), a rightward arrow is labeled "Inventory period Retailer."
   - Between \( t_4 \) and \( t_5 \), a rightward arrow is labeled "A/R period Retailer."
   - Between \( t_5 \) and \( t_6 \), a leftward arrow is labeled "A/P period Retailer."

4. **Cash-to-Cash (C2C) Cycle Arrows:**
   - Above the axis, spanning from \( t_1 \) to \( t_3 \), a rightward raised grey arrow is labeled "C2C-cycle Procter & Gamble (P&G)".
   - Overlapping from \( t_2 \) to \( t_5 \), a rightward arrow is labeled "C2C-cycle SwissPostLogistics (SPL)" in grey.
   - From \( t_4 \) to \( t_6 \), another rightward arrow labeled "C2C-cycle Retailer".

This diagram presents the sequential process and timeframes involved regarding inventory and cash flows across three entities: P&G, SPL, and Retailer.
