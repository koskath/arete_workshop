SwissPostLogistics as the service logistic provider takes some risk as well as ownership of the goods. May be a solution if: (1) refinancing rate of the LSP is lower than that of the other players in the supply chain; (2) the LSP possesses extensive information about sales forecasts and flows of goods in the supply chain; (3) the LSP has capabilities of inventory financing and know-how to evaluate risks; and (4) an equal distribution of power between the involved supply chain parties is given.
