# The image 1 in slide 17 of lecture 9 contains:
The image is a flowchart depicting a warehouse management system (WMS) and its interactions within a supply chain. The chart consists of several blocks connected by arrows, illustrating processes and information flows.

1. **Top Level:**
   - Centered at the top is a rectangle labeled "Management Information System (e.g. ERP)." 
   - Two dashed arrows point downward from this block to two other rectangles labeled "Supplier dispatch information" on the left and "Order processing" on the right.

2. **Middle Level:**
   - Beneath these two blocks, a dashed line connects "Supplier dispatch information" and "Order processing" horizontally, with a dashed arrow pointing downward from the midpoint to a rectangle labeled "WMS."

3. **Third Level:**
   - Four vertical arrows extend downward from "WMS" to four sets of processes:
     - **Left Column:**
       - A vertical stack of three rectangles: "Capture receipt," "Create ID labels," and "Confirm inspection."
     - **Second Column:**
       - A vertical stack of three rectangles: "Select location," "Capture location," and "Cycle counting."
     - **Third Column:**
       - A vertical stack of three rectangles: "Generate pick sequence," "Confirm pick accuracy," and "Requisition replenishment."
     - **Right Column:**
       - A vertical stack of three rectangles: "Generate load sequence," "Confirm inspection," and "Capture dispatch."

4. **Bottom Level:**
   - Four horizontal processes, each represented by a rectangle, aligned parallel at the bottom, connected via solid arrows:
     - "Goods receiving," "Put away into storage," "Order picking & packing," "Goods dispatch."
   - Each of these blocks correlates to one vertical stack from the third level.

5. **Additional Connections:**
   - A solid arrow flows from "Goods receiving" to "Put away into storage," then to "Order picking & packing," and finally to "Goods dispatch."
   - Below "Put away into storage," a dashed line labeled "Cross-dock" loops back to "Order picking & packing."

This flowchart describes the interaction and flow of information between the Management Information System, Warehouse Management System, and various warehouse processes, including goods receipt, storage, picking, packing, and dispatch.
