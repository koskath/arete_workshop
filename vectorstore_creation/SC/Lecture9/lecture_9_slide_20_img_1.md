# The image 1 in slide 20 of lecture 9 contains:
The image displays a technical drawing of a Euro pallet with three different views: side view, front view, and top view.

1. **Top View (Bottom Right Corner):**
   - The pallet is depicted as a rectangular structure with dimensions labeled as 1200 mm (length) and 800 mm (width).
   - It consists of five horizontal slats evenly spaced across the 800 mm width.
   - Each slat is represented as a long, narrow rectangle.
   - There are three vertical blocks shown within the confines of the slat spaces, evenly distributed along the width.
   - The blocks are shown as small rectangles with some spacing between them, providing support structure.
   
2. **Side View (Top Right Corner):**
   - The pallet is represented as a narrow rectangle running horizontally along a 1200 mm line.
   - Underneath, there are two smaller rectangular blocks visible, corresponding to the internal support blocks seen in the top view.
   - The central space is divided symmetrically, labeled as 382.5 mm on each side, with each end marked as 145 mm.
   - Above the blocks, the horizontal slats are shown, consisting of two stacked rows with dimensions 22 mm for the bottom row and 144 mm for the top row, totaling 166 mm in height.
   
3. **Front View (Top Left Corner):**
   - Similar to the side view, but it has a different arrangement of blocks.
   - The total height is marked as 144 mm, divided into specific segments labeled 22 mm, 100 mm, and 22 mm.
   - Three vertical blocks are visible, each labeled 145 mm wide with gaps in between.

4. **Annotations and Labels (Bottom Left Corner):**
   - The text "PALETTE EUR - EPAL ©" is printed.
   - Two elliptical shapes contain the words "EPAL" and "EUR" respectively.
   - Dimensions and spacing are further detailed with lines and numerical annotations, marking various lengths such as 40 mm, 100 mm, 145 mm, and 227.5 mm.

These views collectively illustrate the structure and dimensions of the Euro pallet.
