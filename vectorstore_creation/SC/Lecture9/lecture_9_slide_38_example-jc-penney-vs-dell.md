  - "Accounts Receivable (10 Days)" at the bottom, with a shorter striped bar.
  
- Annotations:
  - A dashed line extends downwards from the right end of the "Accounts Payable" bar to the right end of the "Inventory" bar.
  - A solid line connects the right end of the "Inventory" bar to the left end of the "Accounts Receivable" bar.

- Three horizontal bars labeled with:
  - "Accounts Payable (55 Days)" at the top, the longest striped bar.

  - "Accounts Receivable (33 Days)" at the bottom, a moderately long striped bar starting aligned with the right end of the "Inventory" bar.
  
- Annotations:
  - A dashed line extends downwards from the right end of the "Accounts Payable" bar to the right end of the "Inventory" bar.
