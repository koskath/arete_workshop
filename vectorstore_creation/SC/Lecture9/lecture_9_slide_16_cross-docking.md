# Slide 16 of Lecture 9 contains information about Cross Docking and Merge-in-Transit

The image contains two flow diagrams side by side, labeled "Material flows in cross-docking" on the left and "Material flows in merge-in-transit" on the right.

**Left Diagram (Material flows in cross-docking):**

- **Top Box:** Labeled "Manufacturer." 
- **Middle Box:** Labeled "Intermediary," connected vertically with a straight line to the "Manufacturer" box above it.
- **Bottom Row:** Contains two boxes labeled "Customer company." Both boxes are connected with downward slanting arrows originating from the "Intermediary" box above them.
- The structure is linear from top to bottom, forming a single vertical flow from "Manufacturer" to "Intermediary" and then branching out to two "Customer company" boxes.

**Right Diagram (Material flows in merge-in-transit):**

- **Top Boxes:** Two boxes at the top, each labeled "Manufacturer."
- **Middle Box:** Labeled "Intermediary," connected with two diagonal lines, one from each "Manufacturer" box above.
- **Bottom Row:** Contains two boxes labeled "Customer company." Each "Customer company" box has a diagonal line connecting back up to the "Intermediary" box.
- The structure shows converging lines from two "Manufacturer" boxes to one "Intermediary," then diverging lines from "Intermediary" to two separate "Customer company" boxes.

Both diagrams have a clear flow from the top starting with manufacturers to intermediaries, and finally to customer companies at the bottom. The key difference is the path convergence and divergence, highlighting two different material flow strategies.
