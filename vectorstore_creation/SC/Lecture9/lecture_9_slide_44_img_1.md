The image features the cover of a case study titled "Missing Boxes in Central Europe," published by Copenhagen Business School. It mentions the involvement of Associate Professor Günter Prockl and Student Assistant Kirsten Weibrecht Kristensen in its creation.

### Connection to Supply Chain Analytics:

1. **Problem Identification:**
   - The title "Missing Boxes" indicates a supply chain issue related to the tracking and management of inventory. Supply chain analytics can identify patterns and root causes of such discrepancies.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - By analyzing logistics data, trends in lost shipments or theft can be detected. Analytics tools can help in developing predictive models to forecast and prevent potential issues.

3. **Optimization:**
   - The case can be used to explore optimization techniques, ensuring resources are allocated efficiently to minimize losses.

4. **Risk Management:**
   - Supply chain analytics provides insights for effective risk management strategies, helping to reduce the risk of missing shipments and improve reliability.

5. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Implementing key performance indicators (KPIs) derived from analytics can help track the efficiency of the supply chain and identify areas for improvement.

6. **Decision Support:**
   - The case could illustrate how data-driven decision-making can enhance operational efficiency and responsiveness in the supply chain.

In summary, this case study exemplifies the application of supply chain analytics to address operational challenges, enhance visibility, and improve overall efficiency.
