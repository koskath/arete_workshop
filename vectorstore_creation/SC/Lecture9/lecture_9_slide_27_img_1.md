# The image 1 in slide 27 of lecture 9 contains:
On the left side of the image, there is a perspective view of a mechanized shelving system. A person stands in front of it, interacting with a long horizontal row of shelves that extend along the length of a large, rectangular structure with a vertical orientation. The shelving system consists of multiple layers or tiers of shelves stacked above each other. There is an indication of shelf movement or rotation reflected by a circular arrow on the side of the structure, showing upward and downward movement.

On the right side, there is a schematic diagram of the same shelving system. This diagram is enclosed in a dotted rectangle and arranged vertically, showing a top-down view of the system. Within the rectangle, there are several small rectangular blocks arranged in two parallel vertical columns with spaces in between. An outlined oval shape encloses the columns, suggesting a closed loop or carousel system. An upward-pointing arrow is next to the diagram, indicating direction or movement. A small isolated rectangle stands to the right of the arrow. The layout suggests that the shelves circulate within the oval path, moving up on one side and down on the other.
