# The image 1 in slide 28 of lecture 9 contains:
The image consists of four distinct diagrams, each illustrating a different warehouse or order processing workflow.

1. **First Diagram (Leftmost)**:
   - Three vertical, evenly spaced, dark rectangular blocks are labeled with curved arrows connecting them, indicating movement or workflow.
   - Two arrows originate from the central block, leading downwards to two separate processes: the left arrow points to a stack of horizontally-aligned rectangles labeled "Packing," and the right arrow points to a rectangle labeled "Picking order."
   - Both "Packing" and "Picking order" rectangles have arrows pointing downward, merging into a single downward arrow that leads to the label "Delivery."

2. **Second Diagram (Second from Left)**:
   - Similar structure with three vertical, dark rectangular blocks that have curved arrows connecting them.
   - A single downward arrow emerges from the middle block, leading to a rectangle labeled "Packing."
   - Another similar arrow leads to a rectangle labeled "Picking order."
   - Both "Packing" and "Picking order" have arrows pointing downwards, converging into a single arrow labeled "Delivery."

3. **Third Diagram (Second from Right)**:
   - Three separated vertical dark rectangles labeled at the top as "Zone A," "Zone B," and "Zone C" from left to right.
   - Curved arrows connect these zones indicating workflow between them.
   - Arrows from "Zone A" point to a rectangle labeled "Sorting Packing," which then leads to an arrow labeled "Delivery."
   - Arrows from "Zone B" converge into "Sorting Packing" and another labeled "Picking order," both leading to "Delivery."
   - "Zone C" also connects to "Picking order."

4. **Fourth Diagram (Rightmost)**:
   - Three vertical, dark rectangular blocks are shown with curved arrows connecting them.
   - Curved arrows from the first two blocks point to a rectangle labeled "Sorting Packing" and then direct the movement to "Delivery."
   - A separate arrow from all blocks leads to a rectangle with an upward pointing arrow annotated "Need per item."

Each diagram illustrates various stages of a warehouse or delivery process with emphasis on the flow and transition from one stage to another using arrows and labeled rectangles.
