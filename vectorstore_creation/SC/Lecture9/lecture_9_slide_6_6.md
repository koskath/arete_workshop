# Slide 6 of Lecture 9 contains information about Outbound Logistics and Warehousing

This diagram outlines four distinct structural approaches to global outbound logistics, categorizing them by how inventory is handled physically between the "Home Firm" and the final "Consumer" across international borders. The "Classic Distribution System" depicts a multi-echelon model where material handling occurs at two major nodes: goods move from the manufacturer to a central warehouse within the home country, transfer across the border to a regional warehouse abroad, and are finally delivered to the customer. The "Transit Systems" offer a leaner alternative by removing one storage node; inventory is either held centrally at home and shipped directly to the foreign consumer, or it bypasses domestic storage entirely to be staged at a regional warehouse abroad. A more complex variation is shown in the "Multi-Country-Systems," where a central warehouse is established in a "Third Country" to act as an intermediary hub, feeding either a regional warehouse in the destination country or shipping directly to the consumer. Finally, the "Direct Delivery" model illustrates the most streamlined flow with the lowest handling requirements, where products travel directly from the home firm to the consumer without passing through any intermediate central or regional warehouses.
