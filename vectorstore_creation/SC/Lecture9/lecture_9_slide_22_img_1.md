# The image 1 in slide 22 of lecture 9 contains:
The image contains three separate diagrams, each depicting a different type of conveyor system.

1. **Left Diagram: "Roller tracks in high warehouse"**
   - The leftmost diagram shows a perspective view of a series of roller tracks leading into a high warehouse.
   - To the top-left, there are stacked, rectangular shelves arranged in multiple vertical columns and horizontal rows.
   - Each set of shelves is aligned above the roller tracks, which are oriented diagonally from the foreground to the background in the image.
   - The tracks consist of a series of parallel lines, indicating the individual rollers.
   - The diagram is labeled at the bottom as "Roller tracks in high warehouse."

2. **Middle Diagram: "Roller tracks in production"**
   - The center diagram depicts a curving series of roller tracks.
   - The tracks bend from the lower-left of the image to the upper-right, forming a gradual curve.
   - Several box-like shapes rest on the tracks, following the curve.
   - The rollers are represented by horizontal lines across the track, similar to those in the first diagram.
   - Below the image is the label "Roller tracks in production."

3. **Right Diagram: "Chain-linked ceiling and floor-based conveyors"**
   - The rightmost diagram shows a chain-linked conveyor system.
   - The conveyor starts vertically from the top of the image, suggesting it is ceiling-mounted.
   - It transitions smoothly into a horizontal section where multiple objects, resembling bottles, are placed.
   - This horizontal path appears to integrate another floor-based conveyor.
   - The bottles are arranged in a single line, following the curve where the vertical and horizontal segments meet.
   - Labeled underneath as "Chain-linked ceiling and floor-based conveyors."

Each diagram is distinct and visually separated, focusing on illustrating different conveyor systems used in industrial or warehouse settings.
