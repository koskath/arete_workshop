# The image 1 in slide 20 of lecture 13 contains:
The image is a complex diagram structured into three main sections: "Idea to Market," "Business Readiness," and "Order to Payment." Each section is filled with a series of arrows, labels, and annotations that detail processes and flows.

1. **Idea to Market Section:**
   - Positioned at the top left.
   - Contains two sub-processes:
     - "Research/Development": Indicated with a series of outlined arrows pointing right.
     - "Strategic Marketing": Continues with similar arrows leading to a gray vertical bar labeled "Target."

2. **Business Readiness Section:**
   - Located centrally.
   - Contains a gray vertical bar on the left labeled "Ressources."
   - Four main processes:
     - "Media-/Salesforce Deployment": Contains interconnected arrows looping back on themselves.
     - "Key Account": Series of outlined arrows pointing right.
     - "Sales Process": Outlined arrows transitioning into looping arrows.
     - A gray vertical bar on the right labeled "Customer."
   - Arched arrows connect each process, suggesting iteration or flow back.
   - Below these processes, a label reads "Production Readiness" with arrows in loops.
   - Dashed arrows interconnect various elements indicating a "Customer Relationship Management Process."

3. **Order to Payment Section:**
   - Occupies the bottom section.
   - Begins with a gray vertical bar on the left labeled "Vendors/Suppliers."
   - Contains three main processes:
     - "Forecasting": Indicated by consecutive green-topped arrows aligning forward.
     - "Production/Distribution": Blue-topped arrows leading to the right.
     - "Order-Entry," "Order Fulfilment," "Payment-Flow": Red and blue arrows in loops, converging into a continuous flow.
   - Arrows continue to a gray vertical bar on the right labeled "Customer/Market."
   - Looped and curved arrows suggest the workflow and feedback loops.

4. **Adaptation and Evolution Section:**
   - Located at the bottom.
   - Contains a process titled "Controlling" with looping arrows.
   - "Plans/Budget": Outlined arrows pointing right, connected with arched lines suggesting iteration or adjustment.

Overall, the diagram depicts interconnected processes, illustrating the flow from idea conception to market readiness, and subsequent order to payment processes. The use of different colored arrows and loops indicates complex interactions and iterative cycles.
