# The image 1 in slide 39 of lecture 13 contains:
The image is a diagram illustrating a supply chain process, starting from "Raw Materials" on the left and ending with "End customer" on the right. Both "Raw Materials" and "End customer" are enclosed in vertical yellow rectangles on either end of the diagram. A black horizontal line connects these two points.

1. **Horizontal Process Flow:**
   - The horizontal flow is divided into sections labeled from left to right: "Production," "Assembly," "Manufacturer DC," "Distributor DC," and "Store."
   - The titles under "Manufacturer DC," "Distributor DC," and "Store" have crossed-out 'X' marks, indicating their exclusion in the process.

2. **Push and Pull Arrows:**
   - Above this line, to the left, there is a horizontal arrow labeled "Push" pointing from "Raw Materials" to "Assembly."
   - Above this line, to the right, another horizontal arrow labeled "Pull from customer demand" points from "End customer" to the labeled section "Demand forecast made at assembly."

3. **Inventory and Forecast Sections:**
   - Between "Raw Materials" and "Assembly," there's a red vertical arrow pointing upward labeled “Parts inventory made on forecast.”
   - Above "Assembly," there is a white rectangle labeled "Demand forecast made at assembly." An upward-pointing black vertical arrow connects this rectangle to the "Assembly" section.
   - Across the top, there is text reading "No inventory of finished products," located between "Demand forecast made at assembly" and "End customer."

4. **Additional Elements:**
   - At the top of the diagram, in a purple rectangle with a gray border, there's text with two bullet points:
     - "High level of demand uncertainty"
     - "Low delivery cost (% to the unit price)"

The diagram's overall flow indicates a streamlined process focusing on demand forecasting and minimizing inventory levels.
