# Slide 14 of Lecture 13 contains information about e.g. Supply Chain Relation Spectrum
In the supply chain relation spectrum (see lesson 3), the green arrow describes increasing complexity and sophistication of several important elements. As collaboration deepens, **information systems**, **systems infrastructure**, **decision support systems**, **planning mechanisms**, **information sharing** and **process understanding** all become more advanced and more tightly integrated. Moreover, higher levels of collaboration imply that both trading partners need to have equivalent, or at least close, levels of supply chain maturity in order for the relationship to function effectively. At the most advanced end, **synchronized collaboration** demands joint planning, shared R&D and extensive sharing of information and processing models, leading to movement towards real‑time customer demand information throughout the supply chain and across a range of relationships. This spectrum of collaboration, adapted from Cohen and Roussel (Slide 14), ranges from **transactional**, **cooperative**, and **coordinated** relationships up to **synchronized relationships**, and it also reflects the **extent of collaboration**—from limited relationships with low return to extensive but potentially not viable arrangements—as well as the **number of relationships**, moving from many to few, as captured in Strategy & Configuration.
