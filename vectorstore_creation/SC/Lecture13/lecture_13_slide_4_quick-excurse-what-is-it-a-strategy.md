# Slide 4 of Lecture 13 contains information about Quick Excurse: What is it – A Strategy
A strategy can be understood in several complementary ways. First, it can be seen as a **plan**, that is, a consciously intended course of action and a guideline (or set of guidelines) to deal with a situation. Moreover, strategy can be viewed as a **ploy**, meaning a specific maneuver intended to outwit an opponent or competitor. In addition, strategy may be interpreted as a **pattern**, where the distinction between intended and realized strategy becomes important and where the resulting behavior forms a recognizable pattern in a stream of actions, combining both realized and unrealized strategy. Furthermore, strategy can be regarded as a **position**, because it concerns locating an organisation in an environment, for example by choosing a particular product–market combination. Finally, strategy can be seen as a **perspective**, namely an ingrained way of perceiving the world that enters the realm of the collective mind and unites individuals through common thinking and/or behaviour. All of these views together help to explain what we mean by strategy in the context of Strategy & Configuration Slide 4.
