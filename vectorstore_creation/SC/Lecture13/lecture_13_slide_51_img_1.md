# The image 1 in slide 51 of lecture 13 contains:
The image is divided into two main sections. On the left side, there is a diagram illustrating a supply chain flow and a definition of cross docking. On the right side, there is a list of optimization benefits.

**Left Section: Diagram and Definition**
1. **Diagram**
   - Three suppliers are labeled as "Supplier A," "Supplier B," and "Supplier C," each represented by an icon of a warehouse with yellow packaging boxes, placed vertically aligned.
   - Arrows point rightward from each supplier towards a central box labeled "Cross dock," colored in yellow.
   - From the "Cross dock" box, three arrows continue to extend rightward, each pointing to a different customer labeled as "Customer A," "Customer B," and "Customer C."
   - "Customer A" is in a blue box, "Customer B" in a green box, and "Customer C" in a gray box.

2. **Definition**
   - The heading "Definition cross docking:" is bolded.
   - Below the heading, a paragraph reads: "Cross docking is the direct flow of goods from the receiving area to the shipping area in the warehouse, with a minimum dwell time and as little handling and storage in between as possible."

3. **Source Information**
   - A citation at the bottom reads: "Source: Apte and Viswanathan (2000), p. 301; Werner (2002), p. 57; Gümüs and Bookbinder (2004), p. 199"

**Right Section: Optimization Benefits**
- The title "Optimization" is bolded in blue.
- A bulleted list enumerates the following benefits:
  1. "Reduced inventory levels along the entire supply chain"
  2. "Improved economies of transportation costs due to consolidation of less than truck load (LTL) to FTL shipments without increasing the average inventory level"
  3. "Optimized material flow and lead time"
  4. "Due to reduced storage time increased product shelf life"
  5. "Optimized warehouse operations and facility utilization"

The background is light blue, and the diagram and text are neatly organized within this layout, with the diagram on the left half and the text list on the right half.
