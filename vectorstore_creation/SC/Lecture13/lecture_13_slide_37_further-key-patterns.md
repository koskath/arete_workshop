This slide presents Hau Lee's "Typology of Supply Chains," a strategic framework that categorizes supply chain strategies based on two dimensions of uncertainty. The horizontal axis measures "Demand Uncertainty," distinguishing between "low" uncertainty for "functional Products" and "high" uncertainty for "innovative Products". The vertical axis assesses the "Unsecurity of Supply" (supply uncertainty), ranging from "low" for "stable" processes to "high" for "new" or evolving processes.

By intersecting these variables, the matrix identifies four distinct supply chain strategies tailored to different environments. When both demand and supply are stable (top-left), the ideal approach is an "Efficient Supply Chain," which prioritizes cost reduction and lean operations. If supply is stable but demand is unpredictable due to product innovation (top-right), a "Responsive Supply Chain" is required to react quickly to market fluctuations. In scenarios where demand is predictable but the supply process is unstable (bottom-left), companies should implement "Risk-hedging Supply Chains" to safeguard against shortages or disruptions. Finally, in the most volatile quadrant where both demand and supply are highly uncertain (bottom-right), the framework prescribes "Agile Supply Chains," which must be both responsive to customers and resilient to supply risks.
