# Slide 25 of Lecture 13 contains information about WHAT Scope? Basic – Extended - Ultimate

This diagram conceptualizes the expanding definition of a supply chain, illustrating four progressive levels of complexity starting from a simple transaction and evolving into a comprehensive ecosystem. The most fundamental level is labeled "Partnership," depicting a direct, one-to-one relationship between a Seller and a Buyer. This scope widens to the "Basic Supply Chain," which places a "Focal Firm" in the center of a linear flow, connecting immediately upstream to a Supplier and downstream to a Customer. The model then expands into the "Extended Supply Chain," which recognizes the multi-tiered nature of modern logistics by including the "Supplier’s Supplier" and the "Customer’s Customer," effectively mapping the entire physical journey from raw material to consumption. Finally, the "Ultimate Supply Chain" represents the most sophisticated view; it retains the end-to-end flow from Initial Supplier to Ultimate Customer but integrates auxiliary service providers—such as "Financial Providers," "Third Party Logistics Suppliers," and "Market Research Firms"—demonstrating that a mature supply chain is a complex web of interdependent organizations rather than just a linear pipeline of goods.
