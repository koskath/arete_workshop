The slide presents a framework linking competitive factors valued by customers to corresponding performance objectives that operations need to excel in for effective supply chain management. 

- **Low Price**: Tied to the performance objective of **Cost**, indicating that operations should focus on minimizing costs to offer competitive pricing.
  
- **High Quality**: Linked to **Quality** as a performance objective, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high standards in products and services to meet customer expectations.

- **Fast Delivery**: Connected to **Speed** in operations, which highlights the need for quick processes and efficient logistics to ensure rapid delivery times.

- **Reliable Delivery**: Associated with **Dependability**, where the focus is on ensuring consistency and reliability in delivery schedules to build trust and satisfaction.

- **Innovative Products and Services**: Related to **Flexibility (products/services)**, pointing to the need for adaptive processes that allow for product and service innovation.

- **Wide Range of Products and Services**: Tied to **Flexibility (mix)**, suggesting that operations must be able to handle a variety of products to cater to diverse customer needs.

- **The Ability to Change the Timing or Quantity of Products and Services**: Connected to **Flexibility (volume and/or delivery)**, underlining the importance of adaptable supply chain processes that can adjust to variations in demand and scheduling.

In the context of supply chain analytics, this framework can be operationalized by leveraging data analytics to measure and optimize these performance objectives. For instance, cost can be controlled through predictive analytics that forecasts demand and optimizes inventory levels. Quality can be ensured using analytics tools that monitor production processes and identify defects. Speed and dependability can be enhanced through real-time tracking and data-driven logistics planning. Flexibility can be supported by analytics that allows for scenario planning and rapid response to market changes. This holistic approach enables a supply chain to be responsive to customer needs while maintaining efficiency and effectiveness.
