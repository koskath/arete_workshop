# The image 1 in slide 13 of lecture 13 contains:
The slide consists of a 2x2 grid matrix, with each section having a different background color. The top left quadrant has a light blue background labeled "Country A," the top right quadrant has an orange background labeled "Country B," the bottom left quadrant has a light green background labeled "Country C," and the bottom right quadrant has a light yellow background labeled "Country D."

In the top half of the image, titled "Centralized Production" on the left and "Regional Production" on the right, the following details are observed:

- In "Country A," there is a cluster of four small purple squares arranged in a 2x2 grid, with arrows pointing right, down, and diagonally towards "Country B" and "Country D."

- In "Country B," a cluster of four small orange squares is arranged in a 2x2 grid, with arrows pointing in all four cardinal directions: up, down, left, and right.

- In "Country C," a cluster of four small green squares is arranged in a 2x2 grid, with arrows pointing in all directions except left and right.

- In "Country D," a cluster of four small yellow squares is arranged in a 2x2 grid, with arrows pointing in all four directions.

In the bottom half of the image labeled "Regional Specialization" on the left and "Vertical Integration" on the right, the following details are observed:

- A network of squares is evident, with lines connecting all sections:

  - In the "Regional Specialization" section, there are solid colored squares: purple in "Country A," orange in "Country B," green in "Country C," and yellow in "Country D." Each square has multiple arrows: 
    - The purple square has arrows pointing to and from all other colored squares.
    - The orange square has arrows pointing to and from all other colored squares.
    - The green square has arrows pointing to and from all other colored squares.
    - The yellow square has arrows pointing to and from all other colored squares.

- In the "Vertical Integration" section, the solid colored squares remain but with fewer connections:
  - The purple square in "Country A" has an arrow pointing to the orange square in "Country B."
  - The orange square in "Country B" has an arrow pointing to the yellow square in "Country D."
  - The green square in "Country C" has an arrow pointing to the purple square in "Country A."
  - The yellow square in "Country D" has an arrow pointing to the green square in "Country C."

The quadrants are outlined by a thicker border, with the entire diagram flanked by dark blue vertical panels on either side labeled "Centralized Production," "Regional Production," "Regional Specialization," and "Vertical Integration."
