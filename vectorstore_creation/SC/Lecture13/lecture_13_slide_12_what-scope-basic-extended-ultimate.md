# Slide 12 of Lecture 13 contains information about WHAT Scope? Basic – Extended - Ultimate
When we ask “what scope?” in supply chain management, we can distinguish between basic, extended and ultimate perspectives. At the most **basic supply chain** level, we focus on the relationship between **seller and buyer**, where a supplier, the focal firm and the customer form the core triad and may be linked through some form of partnership. Extending this view, the **extended supply chain** not only considers the supplier, focal firm and customer, but also includes the supplier’s supplier and the customer’s customer, capturing a longer sequence such as “… supplier – focal firm – customer …” together with upstream and downstream partners, including third‑party logistics suppliers and other intermediaries. Finally, the **ultimate supply chain** broadens the scope even further to involve initial and ultimate suppliers and customers, as well as actors such as **financial market providers** and **research firms**, again arranged around the central chain of “… supplier – focal firm – customer …”. This progression from basic to extended to ultimate supply chain scope follows Mentzer et al. (2001, p. 7) and is summarised in Strategy & Configuration Slide 12.
