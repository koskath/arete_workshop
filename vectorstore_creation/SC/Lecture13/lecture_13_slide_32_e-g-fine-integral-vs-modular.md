# Slide 32 of Lecture 13 contains information about e.g. Fine: Integral vs. Modular
Integrated Products Integrated Supply Chain
– Components are tightly coupled – Closely coupled elements
– Components perform several – Elements are not interchangeable
functions – Strong geographical proximity
– Components are in close physical
– Shared responsibility
proximity or strong relationship
– Tightly synchronized processes
– Components are closely
– Similar cultures
synchronized
– Coordinated information systems
Modular supply chains
Modular Products
– Loosely coupled elements – Components are loosely coupled
– Interchangeable elements
– Components are interchangeable
– Low geographic proximity
– Components are individually
optimized (improved) – Autonomous responsibility
– Components have standard – Hardly synchronized processes
interfaces
– Different cultures
– Disparate information systems
