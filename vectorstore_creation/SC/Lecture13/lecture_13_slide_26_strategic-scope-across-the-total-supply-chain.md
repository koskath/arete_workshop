# Slide 26 of Lecture 13 contains information about Strategic Scope across the total supply chain

This slide conceptualizes the "Strategic Scope" essential for achieving alignment, commonly referred to as "Strategic Fit," within a global supply chain network. It presents a matrix that intersects the sequential physical stages of the value chain—Suppliers, Manufacturer, Distributor, Retailer, and Customer—with the organization's key functional strategies, specifically Competitive Strategy, Product Development Strategy, Supply Chain Strategy, and Marketing Strategy. The dominant visual element is the word "FIT" superimposed in large red letters across the entire grid, emphasizing that sustainable success relies on the consistency and alignment of these strategies across all stages rather than in isolation. The "Supply Chain Strategy" row is specifically highlighted with blue blocks containing the text "You are here" or "Or here," which span geographically from the Manufacturer through the Distributor to the Retailer. This visualizes the varying degrees of strategic scope, illustrating that a company's supply chain strategy may be narrowly focused within its own walls (intra-company) or, ideally, expanded to include downstream partners (inter-company scope) to maximize total surplus and competitive advantage.
