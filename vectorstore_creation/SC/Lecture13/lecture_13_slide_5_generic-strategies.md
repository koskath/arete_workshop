# Slide 5 of Lecture 13 contains information about Generic Strategies
Generic strategies are based on the search for a source or basis for competitive advantage, and they can be thought of as different strategy fragments that firms may combine. At a broad level, companies may pursue cost leadership, aiming for lower cost than the competition, or they may focus on differentiation, seeking to distinguish their offerings from those of rivals. When it comes to target scope, firms can either address a broad market or adopt a narrow focus. Thus, in a narrow target context, organisations may choose between cost focus and differentiation focus (sometimes referred to here as target focus), each of which attempts to build a defensible competitive position. These different strategic choices, which are often assessed with a competitive score from 1 to 3a or 3b, are summarised in Strategy & Configuration Slide 5.
