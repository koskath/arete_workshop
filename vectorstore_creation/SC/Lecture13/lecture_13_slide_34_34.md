# Slide 34 of Lecture 13 contains information about 34


This slide serves as a conceptual introduction to Supply Chain Configurations, outlining the fundamental theoretical frameworks used to design and classify logistics networks. It signals a shift from discussing individual components to analyzing the "dominant themes" and "basic patterns" that define how a supply chain operates as a whole system. The core concept introduced here is the Push/Pull boundary, also known as the Customer Order Decoupling Point (CODP). This boundary represents the critical interface in a supply chain where the flow of materials changes from being "forecast-driven" (Push) to "order-driven" (Pull). Upstream of this point, activities are speculative and based on predicted demand (Push), focusing on efficiency and economies of scale. Downstream of this point, activities are reactive and triggered by actual customer orders (Pull), focusing on responsiveness and customization.

The slide references "Archetypes" and "Configurations," which typically refer to the standard models defined by where this Push/Pull boundary is located. These "basic patterns" generally include Make-to-Stock (MTS), where the boundary is at the finished goods warehouse and the entire production is "pushed" based on forecasts. Another common configuration is Assemble-to-Order (ATO), where the boundary is at the assembly stage; here, components are pushed, but final assembly is pulled by a specific order. A third pattern is Make-to-Order (MTO), in which the boundary is at the raw material stage and production only begins after an order is received.

The slide also lists Postponement as a related concept. This is a strategic decision to delay (postpone) the differentiation of a product until the last possible moment in the supply chain—effectively moving the Push/Pull boundary closer to the customer. By keeping inventory in a generic, semi-finished state for as long as possible, companies can reduce inventory risks while still offering high variety, a "dominant theme" in modern, agile supply chain configurations.
