# Slide 19 of Lecture 13 contains information about At the Core: The Order-to-Payment Flow

The diagram visualizes the fundamental interconnectivity of supply chain activities using a concept referred to as the "Supply-Chain 'S'". This visual metaphor is represented by a thick red winding arrow that weaves through various operational stages, demonstrating how a customer order triggers a cascading series of upstream and downstream actions. The structure is bookended by "Suppliers/Vendors" on the far left and "Customers/End Users" on the far right, emphasizing the end-to-end nature of the process.

The flow originates on the upper right side with the Order Flow, initiated by the customer. This demand signal travels upstream (to the left) to inform Forecasting and subsequently trigger Purchasing activities. The process continues winding through Sourcing, ensuring that the necessary materials and components are secured from the suppliers to meet the anticipated demand.

Once the upstream sourcing and purchasing activities are aligned, the flow winds back towards the center and right, moving through Procurement/Production. This leads to the Fulfillment flow, where the physical goods are prepared and delivered to the customer. The final stage depicted is the Payment Flow, which completes the commercial transaction. The red directional arrow at the bottom points back towards the left, suggesting a feedback loop or the cyclical nature of financial settlement returning to the supply side. The central question posed by the slide is "how to integrate activities in the Supply-Chain 'S'?", highlighting the challenge of synchronizing these distinct functional areas into a cohesive, responsive system.
