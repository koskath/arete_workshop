# Slide 12 of Lecture 1 contains information about Starting Point – Peter Druckers “Darkcontinent” of “Physical Distribution“
There was a discovery of, up to that time, almost forgotten functions, summed up in the notion that “if you can produce it every dummy can ship it”. In 1962, Peter Drucker wrote in Fortune that “we know little more about distribution today than Napoleon's contemporaries knew about the interior of Africa. We know it is there, and we know it is big; and that's about all,” highlighting that physical distribution was one of \"the most sadly neglected, most promising areas of American business\".

Logistics Management then emerged as a systematic approach under the label AFP, focusing on the professionalization, rationalization and technization of the elementary transfer operations: transportation, warehousing and transshipment, for example by means of transportation planning, warehouse optimization and better transshipment technology. As such, Logistics Management became, at that time, a new success factor for management.
