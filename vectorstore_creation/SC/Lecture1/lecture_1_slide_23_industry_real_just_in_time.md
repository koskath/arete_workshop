# Slide 23 of Lecture 1 contains information about Industry: "real" Just-in-Time

# The image in slide 23 of Lecture 1 illustrates Just-in-Time (JIT) manufacturing as it's actually implemented in industry. 
The quotation marks around "real" are significant - they suggest this is showing the practical reality of JIT, not just the theoretical concept. The photo shows a Smart car on an assembly line being built, which demonstrates several key JIT principles:

Parts arrive exactly when needed - Components are delivered to the production line at the precise moment they're required for assembly, rather than being stored in large warehouses
Minimal inventory - No large stockpiles of parts sitting around; everything flows through the system
Continuous flow - The production process moves smoothly as parts arrive synchronized with the assembly schedule

The Smart car is actually a good example to use because Smart (and its parent company at the time) pioneered some innovative manufacturing and logistics approaches. The vehicle's modular design allowed for particularly efficient JIT delivery of major components.
The quotation marks around "real" might also carry a hint of irony or realism - acknowledging that actual industry implementation of JIT often involves compromises and isn't always as perfect as textbook descriptions suggest. Real-world JIT requires careful coordination of suppliers, transportation, and production schedules, and doesn't always work flawlessly.
This contrasts with purely theoretical JIT - showing students what it actually looks like on a factory floor.Retry
