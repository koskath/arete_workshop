# Slide 25 of Lecture 1 contains information about Fred Smith: He got a „C“ for a project paper!
Fred Smith is the founder of FedEx (Federal Express), and the story about the "C" grade has become legendary in business history.
While Smith was an undergraduate student at Yale University in the mid-1960s, he wrote a term paper for an economics class outlining his concept for an overnight delivery service. His idea proposed a revolutionary hub-and-spoke system where packages would be flown to a central sorting hub, then redistributed to their destinations overnight - which became the core model for FedEx.
According to the famous story, his professor gave him a "C" grade on the paper, apparently skeptical that the concept was feasible or economically viable.
In 1971, Smith founded Federal Express, and it became one of the most successful logistics and transportation companies in history, completely transforming the package delivery industry and proving his professor spectacularly wrong.
The story is often used in business schools to illustrate: How truly innovative ideas can be underestimated or dismissed, The importance of persistence and believing in your vision, That academic evaluation doesn't always recognize revolutionary business potential, How logistics innovation can create entirely new markets

It's a particularly fitting example for a supply chain management course, as FedEx fundamentally changed how we think about time-sensitive logistics and the value of speed in delivery networks.
