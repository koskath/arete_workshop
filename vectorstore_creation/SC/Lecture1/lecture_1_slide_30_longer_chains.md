1. Longer Chains including the "Last Mile"

The Amazon Dash Buttons (top left) and Amazon Lockers (top right) illustrate how supply chains now extend directly into consumers' homes and neighborhoods
The "last mile" - getting products from a distribution center to the final customer's door - has become one of the most challenging and expensive parts of the supply chain
E-commerce has dramatically increased the complexity of this final delivery stage

2. Circular Logistics including Return Flows

Traditional logistics was one-way: manufacturer → customer
Modern logistics is circular - it includes reverse flows

The diagram in the middle shows this circular system:

Provider (of reusable packaging)
Sender (manufacturer/distributor)
Receiver (customer/retailer)
LSP (Logistics Service Provider)

The arrows show how reusable containers, packaging, and products flow in a continuous loop rather than being disposed of after one use.
Examples shown:

Reusable shipping containers/totes (blue crates) that circulate between parties
Returnable packaging systems that reduce waste
Product returns from customers (a huge issue in e-commerce)
Container shipping systems (bottom right)

This reflects the shift toward sustainability and the circular economy, where logistics must manage not just forward flows but also the return, recycling, and reuse of materials and products.
