# Slide 34 of Lecture 1 contains information about e.g. Integrating with different length of the chains or the major objectives such as efficiency versus agility, resilience and sustainability.

# The graph in slide 34 of Lecture 1 builds on the Order-to-Payment flow by introducing supply chain complexity and strategic choices.
The three colored circles highlight different supply chain strategies based on where customization begins:

"Short" - Delivered from Stock (red circle, right side):

Products already manufactured and sitting in inventory
Just pick, pack, and ship
Fastest delivery, most efficient
Lowest customization


"Medium" - Made to Order (middle circle):

Manufacturing starts after order is received
Moderate lead time
Some customization possible
Balance between efficiency and flexibility


"Long" - Engineered to Order (blue circle, left side):

Design and engineering happen after customer order
Longest lead time
Highest customization
Most complex, least efficient



The strategic challenge (mentioned in the title):
Companies must balance competing objectives:

Efficiency (low cost, fast throughput)
Agility (quick response to changes)
Resilience (ability to withstand disruptions)
Sustainability (environmental/social responsibility)

The critical questions at the bottom:

"How to determine 'optimal complexity'?" - How much complexity should you have in your supply chain?
"What's the optimal 'customer penetration point'?" - Where should customer-specific requirements enter the supply chain? This is also called the order penetration point or customer order decoupling point.

The further left the penetration point, the more customized but slower and more expensive. The further right, the faster and cheaper but less customized. Finding the right balance for your business and customers is a fundamental supply chain design decision.
