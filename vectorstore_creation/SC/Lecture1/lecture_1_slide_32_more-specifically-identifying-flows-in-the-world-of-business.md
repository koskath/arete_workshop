# Slide 32 of Lecture 1 contains information about ... more specifically: identifying „flows“ in the world of business
# The diagram in slide 32 of Lecture 1 illustrates a critical concept: the difference between organizational structure and actual business flows.
The boxes represent a traditional hierarchical organizational chart - the formal structure of a company with departments, divisions, and reporting lines arranged in a neat tree structure from top management down.
The blue arrows represent the actual flows - how work, information, materials, orders, and processes really move through the organization.
The key insight:

Flows don't respect organizational boundaries
They cut across departments, hierarchies, and silos
They're messy, interconnected, and multidirectional
They often bypass the formal chain of command entirely
They connect directly to the customer in ways the org chart doesn't show

Why this matters for logistics and supply chain management:

You can't manage flows by managing the organizational hierarchy alone
Traditional departmental thinking creates barriers to efficient flow
Real logistics optimization requires understanding these cross-functional flows
Customer demands drive flows that cut through multiple organizational units

This visualization makes clear why supply chain management is challenging - the flows you need to manage (the blue arrows) are far more complex and interconnected than the neat organizational structure (the boxes) suggests. Effective logistics requires seeing and managing the actual flows, not just the formal structure.
