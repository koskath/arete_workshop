# Slide 39 of Lecture 1 contains information about Logistics vs. SCM: not always clear – see Larson and Halvorson's four positions
# The image in slide 39 of Lecture 1 consists of a large rectangle divided into four sections, each labelled with a different schema, with each schema containing one or two ovals.

1. **Top Left Section:**
   - Title: "Traditionalist"
   - Contains two concentric ovals.
     - The larger outer oval is labeled "Logistics."
     - The smaller inner oval, completely encased by the larger one, is labeled "SCM."

2. **Top Right Section:**
   - Title: "Re-labeling"
   - Contains a single oval.
     - The oval is labeled "SCM."
     - The word "Logistics" is also placed inside the oval and is crossed out with a diagonal line from upper-left to lower-right.

3. **Bottom Left Section:**
   - Title: "Unionist"
   - Contains two concentric ovals.
     - The larger outer oval is labeled "SCM."
     - The smaller inner oval, fully encompassed by the larger one, is labeled "Logistics."

4. **Bottom Right Section:**
   - Title: "Intersectionist"
   - Contains two overlapping ovals.
     - The left oval is labeled "Logistics."
     - The right oval is labeled "SCM."
     - They intersect in the center.

The image uses black text for all labels and annotations, with borders and lines being consistent in thickness. There's a black border encircling the entire image.
