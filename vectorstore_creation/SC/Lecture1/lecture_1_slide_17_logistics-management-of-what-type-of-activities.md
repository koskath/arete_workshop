# Slide 17 of Lecture 1 contains information about Logistics = management of what type of activities?

# The graph in slide 17 of Lecture 1 illustrates that logistics management encompasses two interconnected types of activities:

Material-flow-related activities (blue arrow): Transportation, Warehousing, Handling
Information-flow-related activities (green arrow): Order processing
The key insight is that logistics isn't just about moving physical goods. It's equally about managing the information flows that coordinate and control those physical movements.
The circular, interconnected design is important - it shows that these two flows are continuously linked and dependent on each other: You can't effectively move materials without information (Where should it go? When? How much?) Information flow is meaningless without the physical execution (Orders are useless if nothing gets shipped)

The warehouse image in the center represents the point where these flows converge - physical goods are stored and moved based on information about orders, inventory levels, and customer demand.
This diagram establishes that logistics is fundamentally about coordinating both the physical movement of goods AND the information that drives those movements. Modern logistics management requires excellence in both domains simultaneously.
