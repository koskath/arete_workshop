# Slide 18 of Lecture 1 contains information about From functional to cross-functional “Coordination”
# The diagram in slide 18 of lecture 1 is a  titled "Michael Porter's Value Chain" at the top center. It is enclosed in a rectangular border with an inner layout that has both vertical and horizontal divisions.

At the top of the diagram, there is a horizontal section labeled "SUPPORT ACTIVITIES" vertically along its left side, with an arrow pointing upward. This section contains three horizontal rectangles:

1. The topmost rectangle is labeled "Firm Infrastructure."
2. Below that, the second rectangle is labeled "Human Resource Management" with dotted vertical lines connecting it to the sections below.
3. The third rectangle is labeled "Technology Development" with dotted vertical lines connecting it to the sections below.

Beneath the support activities section is a lower section labeled "PRIMARY ACTIVITIES," with an arrow pointing from left to right at the bottom. This area consists of five vertical rectangles arranged horizontally:

1. The first rectangle is labeled "Inbound Logistics."
2. The second rectangle is "Operations."
3. The third is "Outbound Logistics."
4. The fourth is "Marketing & Sales."
5. The fifth and last rectangle is labeled "Service."

To the right side of the entire diagram, there is a vertical arrow labeled "Margin," pointing outward to the right.

The diagram outlines the value chain concept, showing how support activities interplay with primary activities to influence an organization’s margin.
