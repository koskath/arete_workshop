# Slide 17 of Lecture 3 contains information about Actors and their linkages
The image shows a diagram that illustrates a complex network of actors and their linkages, representing a supply chain model highly relevant to a classroom exercise. The model is structured around three main groups: the Manufacturer (Exceso), the Retail channel (Fleming Valumart, Regency Brands), and the ultimate Markets/Consumers. The Manufacturer side includes strategic decision-makers like the CEO and Sales/Marketing, and operational units like the Production Plant, which is the source of the physical flow of goods (indicated by the thick blue arrows) that moves toward the various Retailers (Midwest, South, International) and eventually to the two distinct Consumer Markets (home and international). Critical Information Flows are represented by dashed red arrows: Sales goals and Forecasts move internally from management to the Production Plant for planning, while Positive Company Image Information is directed externally toward the Analyst (McKenna/Valdini), who represents the financial market. Central to the system are the Negotiations (also dashed red lines), which occur at multiple points between the Manufacturer (Sales/Marketing, Production Plant) and the key Retail partners (HQ, International Retailer), signifying the critical process of contracting, pricing, and volume determination. Finally, the linkage labeled "Rumors" highlights the unregulated flow of information from the Retail Headquarter to both the Analyst and the Home Market Consumers, illustrating how external market perception and unverified information can influence financial and consumer decision-making outside the formal control of the core supply chain partners. This entire structure models the crucial interdependencies required for both physical product delivery and strategic business coordination in a modern supply chain.
