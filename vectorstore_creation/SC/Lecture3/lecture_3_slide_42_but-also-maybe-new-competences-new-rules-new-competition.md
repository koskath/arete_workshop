# Slide 42 of Lecture 3 contains information about But also: maybe new competences, new rules, new competition

The image, titled "But also: maybe new competences, new rules, new competition," highlights the rapid transformation of the retail supply chain driven by digital commerce, social media, and evolving consumer fulfillment expectations . The visual emphasizes the emergence of new rules and competition through several elements:

First, an article on "How Style Bloggers Earn Sales Commissions" shows that new actors and new competences in social media are becoming integrated into the sales process, creating new indirect channels to the customer. Second, the H&M Online information details the integration of social media (Facebook, Twitter) into the retail communication strategy and emphasizes the rapid global expansion of its interactive e-shop, indicating that the retail supply chain must now manage both digital interaction and physical fulfillment across numerous countries. Third, the diagram below illustrates a dynamic, new fulfillment model called "Ship, Shop, Shine," where the customer can order online, pick up the goods from their parked car at a location, and have the goods automatically shipped or delivered, demonstrating a dramatic shift in logistics and last-mile service away from traditional store models. Finally, the image of a car being loaded with numerous boxes and the diagram of boxes being shipped underscores the high complexity and volume of small-parcel logistics required by e-commerce, revealing the new competition in delivery speed and customer convenience, all of which necessitate new rules and supply chain competences.
