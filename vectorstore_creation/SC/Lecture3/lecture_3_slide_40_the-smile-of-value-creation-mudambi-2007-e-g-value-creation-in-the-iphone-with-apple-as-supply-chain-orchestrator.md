# Slide 40 of Lecture 3 contains information about The smile of value creation (Mudambi, 2007) – e.g. Value creation in the iPhone with Apple as Supply Chain Orchestrator

The image, titled "The smile of value creation (Mudambi, 2007) – e.g. Value creation in the iPhone with Apple as Supply Chain Orchestrator," applies the U-shaped Smile of Value Creation curve to the specific example of the iPhone supply chain . This model illustrates that the highest Value Added is captured at the ends of the supply chain, while the central Production phase adds the least. In the Pre-Production phase, Apple (US) captures maximum value through basic and applied R&D, product design, and commercialization, relying on specialized firms like ARM Holdings (The UK) for chip design. The low-value middle section includes the dispersed Assembly and Parts manufacturing: for example, Hon Hai Precision Industry (Taiwan) handles Assembly, while Samsung (Korea) and NXP Semiconductor (The Netherlands) produce chips. Finally, the Post-Production phase, again dominated by Apple (US), recaptures high value through Marketing, Brand management, and After-sales services, with firms like TBWA/Chiat/Day (US) managing Advertising. This disaggregated model demonstrates how Apple, acting as the Supply Chain Orchestrator, strategically outsources the low-value-added production while retaining control and capturing the highest value through its core competencies in R&D/Knowledge and Marketing/Knowledge at both ends of the global value chain.
