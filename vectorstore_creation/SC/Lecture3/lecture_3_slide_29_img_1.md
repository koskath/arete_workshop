# The image 1 in slide 29 of lecture 3 contains:
The image is divided into two main sections with annotations and diagrams.

On the left section:
- The title "DELAYED ADAPTION" is at the top, with "Example: thermostat" below it.
- Below the title, there is a circular flow diagram. The diagram consists of five elements arranged in a clockwise direction:
  - Starting at the top left, a curved arrow labeled "DELAY" points to the right. This arrow leads to a text labeled "actual water temperature."
  - In the center, there is a seesaw-like balance with two square weights on its ends.
  - A curved arrow from "actual water temperature" points downward to "desired water temperature" on the right side.
  - Another arrow labeled "temperature difference" points upward towards the seesaw shape.
  - An arrow labeled "tap adjustment" points from the seesaw shape back to the starting point, completing the circular flow.

On the right section:
- A graph is displayed showing a wavy line on a grid.
- The vertical axis is labeled "tap temperature," and the horizontal axis is labeled "time."
- The wavy line crosses the horizontal axis multiple times indicating fluctuation over time.

In the top right corner, there is text labeled "ABWLSCM170X03 18."
