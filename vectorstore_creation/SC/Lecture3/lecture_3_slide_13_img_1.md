# The image 1 in slide 13 of lecture 3 contains:
The image is a movie poster with a collage of horror-themed illustrations and text. At the top of the poster, there is a tagline in white text against a dark background: "IF YOU THINK YOU'RE READY FOR FREDDY, THINK AGAIN." Below this, a large, grotesque face dominates the center, with exaggerated features including an open, screaming mouth, and wild eyes. This face is surrounded by a fiery red and orange glow.

To the upper right of the large face, there is a man in a dark suit with a white shirt, and a partially visible bow tie, looking ominous. Below him, there is a smaller depiction of a woman with long hair, her mouth open as if screaming. Next to her, on the lower right side of the poster, is a man lying down with his head turned towards a glowing golden light, his expression tense. Adjacent to him is another figure that appears distorted and partially obscured.

In the lower section, there are several silhouetted figures, possibly standing on a bridge or a similar structure, against a glowing background. They seem to be looking towards the large face above them.

The title is prominently displayed in stylized text at the bottom-left quadrant of the poster. It reads "A Nightmare" in white, textured font with sharp edges and orange shadowing. The number "3" is placed immediately below, larger and in a bolded, orange font. Underneath the title, in smaller letters, it says "ON ELM STREET" in red, and "DREAM WARRIORS" in green.

In the bottom-left corner, there are logos and copyright details: "TM New Line Productions Inc. © 1987 New Line Productions Inc. All Rights Reserved."

The background is primarily a dark shade, which emphasizes the bright and fiery central illustrations and text.
