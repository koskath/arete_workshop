# Slide 45 of Lecture 3 contains information about And next: Mixing the channels and the challenges: Omni-Channels

The image, titled "And next: Mixing the channels and the challenges: Omni-Channels," provides a progressive model illustrating the evolution of retail strategy from a basic, limited focus to a fully integrated Omni-Channel experience . It begins with Single-channel (The Legacy), where customers experience only a single type of touch-point and retailers operate with just one channel. This progresses to Multi-channel (The Reality), where customers encounter multiple independent touch-points, but the retailer's knowledge and operations remain siloed across different technical and functional departments. The next stage, Cross-channel (The Aspiration), represents an effort to bridge this gap, where retailers operate multiple channels but strive to provide a single view of the customer, although operations are still in functional silos. Finally, the model culminates in the ideal of Omni-channel (The Nirvana), which represents the new challenge: customers experience a single, unified brand, not a separate channel, and retailers leverage their complete, single view of the customer in coordinated and strategic ways to deliver a seamless experience regardless of the touch-point (physical store, mobile, desktop, social media, email). The move to Omni-channel demands a complete integration of the physical and digital supply chains to fulfill orders and manage inventory across all customer access points.
