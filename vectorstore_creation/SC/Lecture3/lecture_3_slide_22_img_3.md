# The image 3 in slide 22 of lecture 3 contains:
The image is a line graph enclosed in a black-bordered rectangle. The title at the top left corner reads "Pasta Italy." Below the title, the vertical axis is labeled "Demand Units," with increments from 0 to 1000. The horizontal axis is labeled "Time Month," indicating months numbered from 1 to 12.

A jagged line represents the data across the graph. It fluctuates significantly, rising and falling irregularly across the months. The line peaks several times, notably around months 3, 6, 7, 9, and 11, with dips in between. The highest peak reaches up toward 1000 units after month 8 and another notable peak near 800 units after month 10. 

A label "Producer" is placed near the center of the graph area, to the right of the jagged line, above the high peak near month 9.

Overall, the graph depicts erratic fluctuations in demand for pasta in Italy across a 12-month period, with no clear trend.
