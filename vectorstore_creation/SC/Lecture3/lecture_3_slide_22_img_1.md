# The image 1 in slide 22 of lecture 3 contains:
The image is a line graph titled "Chicken Soup USA," with a focus on "Demand." The y-axis, labeled "Units," ranges from 0 to 400 in increments of 100. The x-axis represents "Time" in "Month," marked from 1 to 12.

Two lines are plotted on the graph:

1. The "Producer" line, which is the more jagged of the two, shows a significant peak at month 7, reaching just above 400 units. The line fluctuates throughout, rising and falling more sharply in months 4 to 8 before decreasing gradually towards month 12, where it levels closer to 0.

2. The "Retailer" line generally follows a less volatile pattern. It rises more gradually, peaking around month 7, though not as high as the producer line, reaching slightly above 200 units. It then decreases steadily, with minor fluctuations, towards the 12th month, ending around 0 units.

Both lines intersect at various points, with notable convergences at months 3, 5, and 11.

The graph's background is white, and there is a bold black border enclosing the entire graph. Labels for the lines "Producer" and "Retailer" are placed near the highest peak and towards the middle right, respectively. The word "Demand" is prominently displayed near the top left, under the main title.
