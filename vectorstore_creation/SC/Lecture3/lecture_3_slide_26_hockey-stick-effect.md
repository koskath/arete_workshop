# Slide 26 of Lecture 3 contains information about Hockey stick effect
The image depicting a hockey stick serves as a visual representation of the Hockey Stick Effect in supply chain management. This effect describes a sales or demand pattern where a long period of low or stable activity is followed by a sharp and dramatic surge in sales at the very end of a reporting period. This volatility often does not stem from consumer demand but is instead man-made or policy-driven, frequently caused by sales teams pushing to hit end-of-period quotas through incentives or heavy discounting. Furthermore, retailers contribute to this by strategically delaying purchases to exploit these end-of-period price promotions offered by suppliers, a practice known as forward-buying. This concentrated burst of orders puts significant strain on manufacturing capacity and logistics, leading to large, inefficient production batches and ultimately introducing unnecessary volatility into the upstream supply chain.
