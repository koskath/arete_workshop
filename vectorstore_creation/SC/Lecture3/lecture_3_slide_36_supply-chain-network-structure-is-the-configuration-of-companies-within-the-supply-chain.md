# Slide 36 of Lecture 3 contains information about Supply Chain Network Structure “...is the configuration of companies within the supply chain.”

The image, titled "Supply Chain Network Structure," provides a detailed graphical representation of a typical Focal Company's multi-tiered supply chain, defining the configuration of companies and the nature of the linkages that connect them. The structure is depicted as extending outward from the central Focal Company (the solid black square) to both Suppliers on the left (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 to $n$, ultimately reaching the Initial Suppliers) and Customers on the right (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 to $n$, ultimately reaching the Consumers/End-Customers). The complexity of the network is emphasized through four distinct types of process links that illustrate the degree of integration: Managed Process Links (thick black lines) represent actively coordinated and essential relationships, typically with Tier 1 partners; Monitored Process Links (dashed lines) are tracked but less integrated; Not-Managed Process Links (dotted lines) are relationships that exist but are not tracked by the Focal Company; and Non-Member Process Links (purple lines) highlight external actors not officially part of the core chain. This extensive structure visually confirms that supply chain management requires understanding and governing the numerous, varied relationships across multiple tiers to ensure efficient flow and prevent system-wide issues like demand amplification.
