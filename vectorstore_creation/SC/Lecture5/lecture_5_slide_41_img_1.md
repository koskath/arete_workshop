# The image 1 in slide 41 of lecture 5 contains:
The image is divided into two main sections. At the top, a blue rectangular banner features text in white capital letters: "INVENTORY MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW."

On the left side, there are six labeled rectangular panels stacked vertically, each with a yellow-orange hexagonal icon on their left. Each panel lists a different inventory management technique, with specific icons:

1. The topmost panel has a hexagon containing a clipboard with a checkmark icon, labeled "TECHNIQUE 1." It reads "Just-In-Time" on a brown background.
   
2. The second panel down features a shopping cart icon in the hexagon, labeled "TECHNIQUE 3" and reads "Minimum Order Quantity" on a brown background.

3. The third panel down has a bar graph icon in the hexagon, labeled "TECHNIQUE 5" and reads "ABC Analysis" on a brown background.

4. The fourth panel down features an arrow icon in the hexagon, labeled "TECHNIQUE 7" and reads "First-In, First-Out" on a brown background.

Each hexagon is followed by a small green checkmark at its lower right corner.

On the right side, there are also six labeled rectangles, but with different techniques and icons:

1. The topmost row has stacks of boxes in the hexagon, labeled "TECHNIQUE 2" and reads "Economic Order Quantity" on a brown background.

2. The second rectangle down features a delivery truck icon in the hexagon, labeled "TECHNIQUE 4" and reads "Drop Shipping" on a brown background.

3. The third rectangle down features a box icon in the hexagon, labeled "TECHNIQUE 6" and reads "Consignment" on a brown background.

The center of the image shows a cartoon man dressed in red overalls and a yellow cap operating a forklift, which is lifting a tall stack of variously sized brown boxes, some of which have white labels. 

At the bottom right corner of the image, there is the word "EMERGE" written in large white capital letters on a brown background.
