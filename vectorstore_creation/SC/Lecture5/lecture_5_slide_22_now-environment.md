# Slide 22 of Lecture 5 contains information about Now Environment is less predictable…

The image, titled "Now Environment is less predictable...," uses two inventory graphs to contrast an idealized, predictable inventory environment with a more realistic, unpredictable one where demand and/or lead time varies .The top graph illustrates the ideal scenario where both lead time ($L$) and demand are constant. In this predictable environment, the inventory level declines at a steady, fixed rate. The reorder point, $R$, is set perfectly so that the inventory hits zero exactly when the fixed order quantity, $Q$, arrives after the known lead time, $L$, resulting in a perfectly regular sawtooth pattern and requiring no safety stock.The bottom graph introduces unpredictability, asking what happens when either demand or lead time varies. This graph shows an irregular pattern where the inventory depletion rate fluctuates (demand varies) and the lead time itself is different ($L_1$ versus $L_2$). For example, the steeper slope of the inventory line in the second cycle suggests a higher demand rate, and the inventory reaches the reorder point $R$ sooner than expected. Crucially, the inventory line drops below zero before the order arrives during the first cycle (under $L_1$), demonstrating a stockout or lost sales due to a combination of demand variability and potentially long or variable lead time. This illustrates the fundamental need for safety stock in the face of real-world unpredictability to maintain service levels.
