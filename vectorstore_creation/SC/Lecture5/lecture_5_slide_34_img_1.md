# The image 1 in slide 34 of lecture 5 contains:
The image is a table titled "Table 9.3 Stockholding policies for alternative inventory flow types." It contains four columns labeled "Type," "Characteristics," and "Stockholding policy." The table is divided into four rows excluding the header.

1. **Row 1:**
   - **Type:** Base flow
   - **Characteristics:** Predictable high flow rates
   - **Stockholding policy:** Minimum stocks. Direct deliveries from suppliers

2. **Row 2:**
   - **Type:** Wave flow
   - **Characteristics:** Slow moving flow rates. High criticality. Perishable. Peaks are relatively predictable
   - **Stockholding policy:** Minimise stockholding, building them during peak demand period. Direct delivery from supplier where possible

3. **Row 3:**
   - **Type:** Surge flow (1)
   - **Characteristics:** High criticality. Low value. Long lead time. Small physical size
   - **Stockholding policy:** Hold high level of stock thereby allowing safety stock delivery lead time and demand fluctuations

4. **Row 4:**
   - **Type:** Surge flow (2)
   - **Characteristics:** Low criticality. High value. Bulky physical characteristics. Peaks are relatively predictable
   - **Stockholding policy:** Minimise stockholding, building them only during peak demand period. Direct delivery from supplier where possible
