# The image 1 in slide 11 of lecture 5 contains:
The image contains two separate graphs side by side, each illustrating inventory levels over time with different order quantities: small and large.

**Left Graph - Small Order Quantity:**

- **Axes and Labels:**
  - Vertical axis labeled "Inventory level" with an upward arrow.
  - Horizontal axis labeled "Time" with a rightward arrow.

- **Line Structure:**
  - A zigzag pattern representing inventory levels.
  - The line starts at the top left and descends at a consistent angle.
  - Each downward slope is short, followed by a sharp upward vertical line, indicating frequent restocking at small quantities.
  - Ends with a horizontal line at the bottom right.

- **Annotations:**
  - The downward slopes and immediate upward lines create repeated triangular shapes.

**Right Graph - Large Order Quantity:**

- **Axes and Labels:**
  - Vertical axis labeled "Inventory level" with an upward arrow.
  - Horizontal axis labeled "Time" with a rightward arrow.

- **Line Structure:**
  - A larger, sawtooth pattern representing inventory levels.
  - The line descends from a high point to a low point, forming a longer downward slope before sharply rising back up, indicating less frequent restocking at larger quantities.
  - Each downward angle stretches further on the time axis than in the small order quantity graph.
  - Steps are wider and fewer than on the left graph.

- **Annotations:**
  - Letter "Q" is used to label the vertical distance between the peak and low point of the inventory line.

- **Spatial Relationship:**
  - The order quantity is visibly larger, with the inventory level having higher peaks and lower troughs compared to the small order quantity graph.

Each graph effectively contrasts the difference in inventory behavior between small and large order quantities, with both focused on the progression of inventory levels over time.
