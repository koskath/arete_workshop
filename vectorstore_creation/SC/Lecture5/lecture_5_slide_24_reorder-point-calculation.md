# Slide 24 of Lecture 5 contains information about Reorder Point Calculation

The image, titled "Reorder Point Calculation including Safety Stock," presents the mathematical formula used in inventory management to calculate the Reorder Point (ROP) when both demand and lead time are uncertain, a key requirement for managing inventory in unpredictable supply chain environments. The fundamental formula for ROP is defined as the average expected demand during the average lead time, $\bar{D} \times \bar{L}$, plus the necessary Safety Stock (SS), which serves as a buffer against variability. The Safety Stock component is calculated statistically to maintain a target service level: $SS = z \times \sqrt{\bar{L}\sigma_d^2 + \bar{d}^2\sigma_L^2}$. The variables in this detailed formula include $\bar{d}$ for the average demand per time period, $\bar{L}$ for the average lead time, $\sigma_d^2$ and $\sigma_L^2$ for the respective variances of demand and lead time, and $z$, which is the number of standard deviations required to achieve the desired service level (or probability of not stocking out). The complete formula combines the average expected usage during the time an order is in transit with a calculated buffer to ensure the order is placed early enough to prevent a stockout under normal demand and lead time variability.
