# The image 2 in slide 33 of lecture 5 contains:
The image is a layered area chart with an accompanying legend on the right side. The chart is titled with two labels within the layers: "Surge Flow Inventory" and "Wave Flow Inventory." 

**Chart Details:**

1. **Layers:**
   - The topmost layer is a series of sharp, triangular peaks and troughs. This layer represents "Surge Flow Inventory."
   - Below the surge layer is a smoother wave-like layer labeled as "Wave Flow Inventory."

2. **Axes:**
   - The vertical axis on the left is labeled "Inventory Holding $" with the text oriented vertically.

3. **Legend:**
   - Located in a separate box on the right side, containing three items:
     - A square filled with a light pattern labeled "Fad products."
     - A square filled with a medium-dark pattern labeled "Seasonal fashion products."
     - A square filled with a dark pattern labeled "Core business products."

**Spatial Relationships:**
- The "Surge Flow Inventory" layer is positioned above the "Wave Flow Inventory" layer, indicating an additional amount of inventory compared to the stable base.
- Both layers stretch across the width of the chart, with each showing a distinct pattern correlating to inventory behavior as described in the labels.
- The legend associating product types with different shading patterns provides context to the layers shown in the graph.
