# Slide 15 of Lecture 11 contains information about e.g. you could do an ABC Analysis
An example of how you could do an ABC analysis starts with the idea and a checklist of steps. The idea is to use “consumption value” as a selection criteria and to begin with the calculation of the total consumption value of each material per period, where the quantity is multiplied by the cost price. Based on this, you then calculate the percentage with respect to the total number of consumed goods and calculate the percentage with respect to the total consumption value of all goods, and you calculate ranks for the materials. Next, you rank material types in descending order with respect to the total consumption value and classify SKU into different groups. After that, you cumulate these percentages with respect to the total number of consumed goods and cumulate the percentage of the total consumption value of all goods. Finally, you perform the classification of material types in A, B and C goods according to the ABC analysis.
