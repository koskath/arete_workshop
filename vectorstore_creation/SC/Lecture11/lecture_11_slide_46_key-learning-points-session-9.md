# Slide 46 of Lecture 11 contains information about Key learning points: Session 9
Warehousing & Materials Management
Content: Literature:
Key learning points from Session 9, Warehousing & Materials Management, link content and literature on distribution structures and warehousing. The content covers distribution structures and warehousing, value‑adding activities (including cross‑docking and merge‑in‑transit), warehouse management systems (WMS), materials handling, storage and order picking, work organization and job design, logistics performance measures such as inventory turnover and cash‑to‑cash‑cycle, and warehouse layouts, design and processes in warehousing. It also looks at trade‑offs between inventory management techniques and distribution structures for conventional retail and e‑commerce retailers. The literature includes Baker, P. (2007): “An exploratory framework of the role of inventory and warehousing in international supply chains”, International Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 18, No. 1, pp. 64‑80; Johnson, M. and Templar, S. (2011): “The relationships between supply chain and firm performance: The development and testing of a unified proxy”, International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, Vol. 41, No. 2, pp. 88‑103; and Farris, M. T. and Hutchison, P. D. (2002): “Cash‑to‑cash: the new supply chain management metric”, International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, Vol. 32, No. 4, pp. 288‑298.
Main issues:
Some broad questions that address the main issues include “How does a common distribution structure look like in conventional retail and how for an e‑commerce retailer?”, “How important is working capital and metrics like inventory turnover and cash‑to‑cash‑cycle on a supply chain level?” and “How do inventory management techniques influence distribution structures?”. These questions are related to main issues such as warehouse layouts and design, processes in warehousing and trade‑offs between different inventory management approaches.
