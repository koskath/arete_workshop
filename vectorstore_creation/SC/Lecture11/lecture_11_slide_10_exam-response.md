# Slide 10 of Lecture 11 contains information about Exam response
Philosophy
The philosophy of exam response involves several elements. It starts with generating ideas, possibilities and directions for your answer, and then identifying the components and constituents that make up a good answer. It also includes being aware of some quality criteria that your response should meet. However, these points should be seen as guidance rather than a strict pattern—this is not a template. 12.03.2025 Slide 10
