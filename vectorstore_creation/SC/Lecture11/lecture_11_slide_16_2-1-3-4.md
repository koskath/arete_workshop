this image features a detailed data table used to perform an ABC Analysis, a fundamental technique in inventory management for prioritizing items based on their consumption value rather than just their physical quantity. The table lists distinct articles identified by alphanumeric codes (e.g., A 5831, M 7439) and uses four blue numbered indicators to highlight the step-by-step calculation process. The column marked "2" tracks the "Consumption in units," showing the physical volume of items used, while the column marked "1" calculates the "Consumption value in total units" by multiplying that physical volume by the unit price; this reveals that high-volume items like M 7439 (5,000 units) may have a low total value due to a low price, whereas low-volume items like R 6874 can carry the highest financial weight. The column marked "3" expresses this monetary value as a percentage of the total inventory value of 56,600 €, and the final column, marked "4," assigns a "Rank" to each item based on this financial contribution. The result demonstrates the Pareto Principle, where a top-ranked item like R 6874 (Rank 1) accounts for 17.7% of the total value despite low physical usage, guiding managers to focus their strictest controls on these few high-value items.
