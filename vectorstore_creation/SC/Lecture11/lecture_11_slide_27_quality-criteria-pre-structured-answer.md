# Slide 27 of Lecture 11 contains information about Quality Criteria – Pre structured answer
For a pre‑structured answer, several quality criteria are important and can be described together. One criterion is clarity about the problem addressed with the question in the exam: here, this choice is already limited as indicated by the exam question itself, and you should relate already the question to concepts of the course, which turns this into a matter of selection. Another criterion is the approach and path of argumentation: here, the basic approach is already given and needs to be applied, and the focus is on how correct or better “helpful” the application of the indicated method, framework or method is. A further criterion is the presentation and deliverance of the arguments: the question “Is the presentation of the arguments sound and understandable?” concerns the structure and logic of the arguments and the line of arguments, as well as formal and informal aspects of it, like using the correct terms. Finally, results and conclusions are evaluated by asking “Are the right conclusions drawn from the argumentation or the facts?” and “Do the conclusion and results fit or contribute to the question asked?”, which means that, in this respect, the quality criteria are the same as above.
