Inventory Management, Planning and Control
Content:
Literature:
Key learning points from Session 5, Inventory Management, Planning and Control, cover both content and literature and focus on supply chain inventory. The content addresses EOQ and other inventory management concepts, inventory control systems and approaches, ABC/XYZ classification, and supply chain inventory management. It also examines the role and function of inventory in the supply chain, trade‑offs between capacity, service level, lead‑time and inventory, and major types of control systems for inventories, including EOQ, safety stock and reordering tactics, as well as ABC‑Analysis and Flow Analysis (or also XYZ) to develop selective strategies. The literature includes Abernathy, F. H., Dunlop, J. T., Hammond, J. H. and Weil, D. (2000): “Control your inventory”, Harvard Business Review, Vol. 78, No. 6, pp. 169‑176, and Lee, H. and Billington, C. (1992): “Managing Supply Chain Inventory: Pitfalls and Opportunities”, Sloan Management Review, Vol. 33, No. 3, pp. 65‑73.
Main issues: Supply Chain Inventory
Some broad questions that address the main issues of supply chain inventory include “Why do we need inventories?”, “What types of inventory might exist along a supply chain?”, “How much to order and when to order?” and “What are the typical approaches that can be employed for inventory management and control?”. These questions are directly related to the role and function of inventory in the supply chain and to the trade‑offs and control systems discussed above.
