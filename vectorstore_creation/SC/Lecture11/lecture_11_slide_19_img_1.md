# The image 1 in slide 19 of lecture 11 contains:
The image is divided into three main sections, with two text boxes at the top and two zones below, containing a graph. Each section is bordered by a thin line. 

1. **Top Left Section:**
   - Title: "ABC-Analysis - purchasing volume"
   - Subheading with background color: Light blue.
   - Description: "Standard method for categorizing objects into three categories. The ranking depends on the importance of the analyzed objects."

2. **Top Right Section:**
   - Title: "XYZ-Analysis - Demand Continuity"
   - Subheading with background color: Light blue.
   - Description: 
     - Method for classification of materials by their consumption patterns.
     - Categorizes into three groups based on consumption forecast accuracy.
     - Enables reliable planning.
   - Further details are given under "Grouping in Three Classes":
     - **X-Class:** Materials with regular consumption, constant demand, high forecast accuracy.
     - **Y-Class:** Materials with trend-like consumption (increasing, decreasing, seasonal fluctuations), medium forecast accuracy.
     - **Z-Class:** Materials with irregular consumption, very low forecast accuracy.

3. **Bottom Section - Graph:**
   - **Axes:**
     - X-axis: Labeled "quantity [%]", range from 0 to 100.
     - Y-axis: Labeled "value [%]", range from 0 to 100.
   - **Data Representation:**
     - Three distinct areas labeled "A," "B," and "C."
     - Area A: Dark gray triangular area starting from (0,0) to (20,80).
     - Area B: Light gray rectangular area spans from approximately 20 to 40 on the x-axis, between 50 to 100 on the y-axis.
     - Area C: Dark gray trapezoidal area, spanning approximately from 40 to 100 on the x-axis and 90 to 100 on the y-axis.
   - Segmented lines outline areas A, B, and C.
   - Data points are marked with small red squares on the line boundaries.
   - Background of the graph uses a grid pattern.
