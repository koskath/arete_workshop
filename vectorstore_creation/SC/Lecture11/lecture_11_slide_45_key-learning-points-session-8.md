Content: Literature:
Key learning points from Session 8, Distribution Systems and Service Supply Chains, combine content and literature on distribution and service systems. The content includes distribution channels, online versus brick‑and‑mortar selling, multi‑ and omni‑channels, service supply chains, servitization and service‑dominant logic, and reverse logistics systems, including an Amazon case study. The literature includes Rigby, D. (2011): “The Future of Shopping”, Harvard Business Review, Vol. 89, No. 12, pp. 64‑75, and Verhoef, P. C., Noordhoff, C. S. and Sloot, L. (2023): “Reflections and predictions on effects of COVID‑19 pandemic on retailing”, Journal of Service Management, Vol. 34, No. 2, pp. 274‑293.
Main issues:
Some broad questions that address the main issues include “What is the difference between multi‑ and omni‑channel retailing?”, “What is servitization?” and “What is the difference between a manufacturing and a service supply chain?”. These questions relate to main issues such as current challenges for retailers to deal with growing online sales, products as services, the basics and terminology of reverse logistics and the design of service supply chains.
