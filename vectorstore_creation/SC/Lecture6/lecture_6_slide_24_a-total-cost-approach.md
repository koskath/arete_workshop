# Slide 24 of Lecture 6 contains information about A Total Cost Approach to Supplier Selection
Unit total cost (UTC) is defined as the unit purchase price amended by an appropriate monetary factor to reflect other pure “hard costs” of an item that arise when selecting a specific supplier. To calculate UTC, a five-step framework is followed. First, all total-cost factors that are important to the organisation must be identified, ideally by inviting all stakeholders to point out cost elements and other issues of interest to them regarding the source of supply under evaluation. Second, a “price adder” formula is developed to translate each total-cost factor into a monetary unit based on its perceived level of importance. Third, a debit (or credit) for each total-cost factor, appropriate to each supplier’s performance in relation to those factors, is added to the supplier’s quoted price. Fourth, the quoted price and all total-cost factors are added together to obtain the unit total cost. Finally, the business is awarded to the supplier with the lowest unit total cost.
