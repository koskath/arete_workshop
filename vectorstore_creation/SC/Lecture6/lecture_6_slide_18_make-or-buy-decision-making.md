# Slide 18 of Lecture 6 contains information about Make-or-Buy Decision Making

Make-or-buy decision making considers whether an organisation should produce a product or service internally or obtain it from external suppliers, and these decisions can be mapped along two key dimensions: relative competence and strategic importance. Where the organisation has high relative competence and the product or process is of high strategic importance, a “do-it-yourself” or internal production option is often favoured, and in some cases the firm may even sell products or services based on this competence. If strategic importance is high but the organisation’s own competence is relatively low, partnering with main suppliers and pursuing (out)sourcing arrangements becomes more attractive. Conversely, when strategic importance is low and relative competence is low, outsourcing is more likely, while low strategic importance combined with high internal competence may still justify in-house production but with less strategic focus.
