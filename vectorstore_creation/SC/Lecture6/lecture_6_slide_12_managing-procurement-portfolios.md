   - "Strategy": This entry highlights careful management, describes the bottleneck as potentially technical or commercial, and suggests designing the bottleneck out of the portfolio or ensuring an appropriate supplier relationship.

3. **Row 3:**
   - "Risk/Value": Low/High
   - "Description": Tactical
   - "Strategy": The focus is on ensuring value for money by sourcing from the most appropriate source(s). It discusses increasing sources and maintaining competition between suppliers for continuity of supply.

4. **Row 4:**
   - "Risk/Value": Low/Low
   - "Description": Leverage
   - "Strategy": This text describes aggregation and consolidation of spend. It emphasizes the less critical nature of the source in low-risk/value items as long as continuity of supply and performance requirements are met, with a focus on price.

Each row outlines management approaches tailored to different combinations of risk and value in procurement portfolios. The text is structured as narratives in the Strategy column, providing context and recommendations for each scenario.
