The image is a pie chart divided into twelve equal segments, each labeled with different categories surrounding the chart. Starting from the top center and moving clockwise, the categories are as follows:

1. "Commitment of supplier" - a light grey segment.
2. "General responsiveness" - a grey segment slightly darker than the first.
3. "General reliability" - a medium grey segment.
4. "Communication" - a slightly darker medium grey segment.
5. "Late delivery" - a dark grey segment.
6. "Mistakes" - a very dark grey segment.
7. "Need for frequent reminders" - a dark grey segment similar in shade to "Late delivery".
8. "Customer complaints" - a medium grey segment.
9. "Differences in culture" - a light grey segment.
10. "Time difference" - a black segment, the darkest in the chart.
11. "Quality consistency" - a dark grey segment, similar in color to "Mistakes".
12. "Confidentiality" - a light grey segment.

Additionally, on the left side:

- "Outsourcee being too polite" is aligned with the "Confidentiality" segment.
- "Cost realisation competency" is aligned with the "Commitment of supplier" segment.

Each segment is uniformly divided and distinguished by varying shades of grey, with annotations outside the circle corresponding to the positions of each segment. No specific numerical values or percentages are included within the segments.
