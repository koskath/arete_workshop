Table titled "Table 9.5 The procurement process" with three main columns: "Stage," "Description," and "Key issues."

1. "Stage"
   - Specify

2. "Description" corresponds to each stage:
   - Specify: "Specify the requirements that the contract must deliver"
   - Identify: "Identify suitable potential suppliers who are able to meet the defined requirements or specification"
   - Select: "Select a suitable supplier or suppliers to deliver the contract"
   - Manage: "Manage the contract to ensure that the key deliverables are fully met"

3. "Key issues" are listed in bullet points for each stage:

   - Specify: 
     - "Requirements should be defined from a technical, commercial and end-user perspective"
     - "In many cases organisations do not understand the market better than suppliers"
     - "Sometimes the specification is unclear or ambiguous"

   - Identify:
     - "Advertising and promoting the contract opportunity"
     - "Determining an appropriate level of competition to reflect risk and value being procured"
     - "Attracting new or more interesting suppliers who may be able to add more value to your business versus incumbents"

   - Select:
     - "Choosing which suppliers have the capability and capacity to deliver the required service"
     - "Picking a winning team from suppliers who have tendered for your opportunity to deliver the contract"
     - "The evaluation criteria in terms of quality and price"
     - "The balance needed between quality and price"

   - Manage:
     - "Success criteria or key performance indicators are required to ensure that the contract requirements are being met"
     - "Lessons learned are applied to subsequent contracts"

Each section of the table is separated by horizontal lines, and the columns of the table provide a structured layout, aligning each stage with its description and key issues.
