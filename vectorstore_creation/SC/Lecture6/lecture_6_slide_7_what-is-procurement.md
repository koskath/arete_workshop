# Slide 7 of Lecture 6 contains information about What is Procurement?

Procurement is about specifying requirements, identifying sources, evaluating options and acquiring resources that are fit for purpose, cost-effective and sustainable. It should be considered in terms of the motivation of the buyer and the seller, which is different for each party, and these differing motivations shape how procurement is organised and managed. Further details on these roles and perspectives are provided in Table 8.1 in Mangan and Lalwani (2016). 7
