# Slide 2 of Lecture 8 contains information about Agenda

TOPICS OF TODAY
The topics of today are divided into two main areas: distribution systems and service supply chains. Under distribution systems, we will look at distribution channels, online versus brick‑and‑mortar selling, multi‑ and omnichannels, and things to know about customs when you are travelling or when you do cross‑border online shopping. We will also discuss the case study “Sell Direct‑to‑Consumer or Through Amazon?”. Under service supply chains, we will address servitization and service‑dominant logic, as well as reverse logistics systems. The readings are Textbook 4th ed., Chapter 4 and Chapter 16 (about reverse logistics); Rigby, D. (2011), “The Future of Shopping”, Harvard Business Review, Vol. 89, No. 12, pp. 64–75; and Verhoef, P. C., Noordhoff, C. S. and Sloot, L. (2023), “Reflections and predictions on effects of COVID‑19 pandemic on retailing”, Journal of Service Management, Vol. 34, No. 2, pp. 274–293. 2
