# Slide 25 of Lecture 8 contains information about The diagram in slide 25 of lecture 8 is composed of several labeled boxes and directional arrows indicating the flow of a logistics system.

- At the top is the label "Forward Logistics" with a dotted arrow pointing to the right.

- The system starts from the left with a box labeled "Source." An arrow points right from this box to another labeled "Parts Manufacture."

- Continuing right, an arrow leads from "Parts Manufacture" to "Product Manufacture."

- From "Product Manufacture," an arrow goes right to "Market."

- From the "Market," an arrow loops around and points downward to a box labeled "Collection" at the bottom right.

- An arrow goes left from "Collection" to a box labeled "Test."

- A leftward arrow connects the "Test" box to a box labeled "Re-distribution."

- From "Re-distribution," a right-curving arrow goes up to "Product Manufacture" labeled "Reuse," and an upward left-diagonal arrow points back to "Parts Manufacture," labeled "Remanufacture."

- Another arrow labeled "Recycle" extends from "Re-distribution" and points upward left to "Source."

- A dashed arrow labeled "Reverse Logistics" extends from "Re-distribution" down to a separate box labeled "Disposal."

- All the boxes are connected with solid lines except for the dashed line to "Disposal."

- At the bottom of the diagram is a caption: "Figure 15.1 A generic reverse logistics system with recovery options."
