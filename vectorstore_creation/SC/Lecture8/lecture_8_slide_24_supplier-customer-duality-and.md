# Slide 24 of Lecture 8 contains information about Supplier-customer Duality and Bi-directional Service Supply Chains
# Here is what the diagrams in slide 24 of lecture 8 contain:
**Diagram (a): Single-level bi-directional service supply chain**

1. Three overlapping ovals represent different entities:
   - The left oval is labeled "Material / equipment supplier."
   - The middle oval is labeled "Service provider."
   - The right oval is labeled "Customer."

2. A large, bold, bi-directional arrow labeled "Knowledge and Resources" spans the top of the diagram from left to right. Another arrow with a similar label points from right to left.

3. A smaller, left-facing arrow labeled "Service provision" extends from the left edge of the "Service provider" oval, not touching it.

4. Two gray curved arrows between ovals:
   - One arrow points left from "Customer" to "Service provider" and is labeled "supplying inputs."
   - The other arrow points right from "Service provider" to "Customer" and is labeled "consuming outputs."

5. The title "Single-level bi-directional service supply chain" is positioned to the right of the diagram.

**Diagram (b): Two-level bi-directional service supply chain**

1. Three overlapping ovals represent different entities:
   - The left oval is labeled "Service supplier."
   - The middle oval is labeled "Service provider."
   - The right oval is labeled "Customer."

2. A large, bold, bi-directional arrow labeled "Knowledge and Resources" spans the top of the diagram from left to right. Another arrow with the same label points from right to left.

3. A smaller, downward-left diagonal arrow labeled "Service provision" extends from the bottom of the "Service supplier" oval.

4. Two sets of gray curved arrows between adjacent ovals:
   - Between "Service supplier" and "Service provider":
     - An arrow points left labeled "receiving inputs."
     - Another arrow points right labeled "providing outputs."
   - Between "Service provider" and "Customer":
     - An arrow points left labeled "supplying inputs."
     - Another arrow points right labeled "consuming outputs."

5. The title "Two-level bi-directional service supply chain" is positioned to the right of the diagram.

Both diagrams share similar graphical elements for depicting service supply chains, with variations in the entities and flow processes involved.
