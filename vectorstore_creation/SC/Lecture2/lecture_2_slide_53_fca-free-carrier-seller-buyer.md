# Slide 53 of Lecture 2 contains information about FCA – Free Carrier Seller Buyer


# The image in slide 53 of lecture 2 is a diagram featuring a stylized global supply chain process, arranged horizontally across the image:
 At the top, there are three airplanes equally spaced across the image, each flying from left to right. Beneath the airplanes, two cargo ships are depicted, each fully loaded with containers.

Below the ships, two port facilities are shown, each equipped with cranes that are lifting containers. Between and on both sides of the ports, there are multiple buildings, trucks, and transportation methods depicted:

- On the far left, there is a factory with a rectangular base and three vertical sections of varying heights, one with a triangular top and two with chimney-like structures.

- To the right of the leftmost factory, there are two trucks, each carrying containers. In front of these trucks, there are sets of stacked containers on the ground.

- A gas station is also shown, with a flat-roofed structure featuring a circular front.

- To the far right, near the second factory, there is a similar sequence: more trucks with containers, another gas station, and additional stacked containers on both sides.

At the very bottom of the image, there are four horizontally stacked, differently shaded blue bars or strips with no accompanying text or annotations.

Vertical dashed lines span the top to the bottom of the image, running through key points such as the factories, transportation vehicles, port facilities, and buildings. The overall arrangement highlights different stages and elements involved in the supply chain process.
