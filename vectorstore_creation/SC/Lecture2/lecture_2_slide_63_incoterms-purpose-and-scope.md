# Slide 63 of Lecture 2 contains information about Incoterms – Purpose and Scope
In pricing terms, shipping terms and sales terms, Incoterms define the rights and obligations of the parties to the contract of sale with respect to the delivery of goods sold. They clarify how functions, costs and risks are split between buyer and seller for the delivery of goods, as required by the sales contract.

As you move from group “E” to “D”, the seller's risk and cost on the cargo increase, while the buyer’s risk and cost on the cargo decrease.
