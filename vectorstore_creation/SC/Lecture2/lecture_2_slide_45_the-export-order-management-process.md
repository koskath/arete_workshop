# Slide 45 of Lecture 2 contains information about The Export order management process
Upstream from the export order management process, there are important forecasting and planning activities. These include demand forecasting and export planning, purchasing and logistical requirements, and production scheduling together with logistical requirements such as supply planning and import movements. Export and import order management is therefore closely linked to sourcing decisions.

There are also packaging considerations, including choices of packaging materials, carton types and sizes, pallet types and sizes and container types and sizes.
