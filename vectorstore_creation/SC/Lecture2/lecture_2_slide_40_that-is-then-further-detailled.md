# Slide 40 of Lecture 2 contains information about That is then further detailled
# The image in slide 40 of lecture 2 is a flow diagram titled "S1 Source Stocked Product." It is structured inside a hexagonal shape with a title banner extending from the top left, labeled with a directional arrow pointing rightwards. Below the title, there is a header stating "Level 3 Example — S1 Source Stocked Product.":

The diagram is divided into sections, with three main categories: Inputs, Process Elements, and Outputs.

**Inputs:**
- Located at the top left, with entries as follows:
  - (P2.4) Sourcing Plans
  - (ES.2) Source Execution Data
  - (ES.6) Logistics Selection
  - (M1.1, M2.1, M3.2) Production Schedule
  - (M1.2, M2.2, M3.3, D1.3) Replenishment Signals
  - On the right side under "Inputs": 
    - (Supplier) Sourced Products

**Process Elements:**
- Positioned horizontally across the center, containing four gray boxes labeled:
  - S1.1 Schedule Product Deliveries
  - S1.2 Receive Product
  - S1.3 Verify Product
  - S1.4 Transfer Product
  - S1.5 Authorize Supplier Payment

- Arrows show the process flow:
  - A blue arrow points right from S1.1 to S1.2.
  - A blue arrow points right from S1.2 to S1.3.
  - A blue arrow points downward from S1.3 to S1.4.
  - A blue arrow points right from S1.4 to S1.5.

**Outputs:**
- Located towards the bottom of the hexagon, with annotations:
  - Below S1.1:
    - Procurement Signal (Supplier)
    - Sourced Product on Order (P2.2), (ES.9)
    - Scheduled Receipts (M1.1, M2.1, M3.2, D1.8)
    - Material on Order
  - Below S1.2:
    - Receipt Verification (ES.1, ES.2, ES.6, ES.8)
  - Below S1.3:
    - Receipt Verification (ES.1, ES.2)
  - Below S1.4:
    - Inventory Availability (P2.2, ES.4, M1.2, M2.2, M3.3, D1.8)
  - Below S1.5:
    - ES.9 Payment Terms

**Additional Annotations:**
- Small symbols on the top right corner show legend for the diagram:
  - A rightward arrow labeled "Process flow"
  - A triangular emblem labeled "Inputs and outputs"
  - A circle labeled "Source of inputs"
  - A square labeled "Output destination"

At the bottom outside the hexagon, an additional note is present stating, "Inputs, outputs, and basic logic flow of process elements are captured."

Elements are connected by arrows to indicate the direction of flow, using both blue arrows for process and black dotted lines for providing context related to inputs and outputs. The entire diagram captures the sequence of events and relations concerning the sourcing of stocked products.
