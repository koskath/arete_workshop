# Slide 46 of Lecture 2 contains information about E. G. Transport Mode Selection

# The image in slide 46 of lecture 2 is a schematic representation of a supply chain featuring various modes and facilities:

Starting from the left, there is an icon of a factory with a smokestack and two rectangular windows. In front of the factory, there are several containers and a truck with three sets of wheels, carrying two stacked containers. Moving right, the scene transitions into a train carrying open-topped containers. Next is a gas station icon with a flat roof and a supportive column, accompanied by more containers.

Further to the right, there is a small circular building with a dome top and a signpost adjacent to it, suggesting navigation or a stop. More containers follow, next to a large, blocky building with small windows and a slanted rooftop. 

Amidst this linear sequence are three large cargo ships with visible anchors on their bows and stacked containers on deck. These ships are surrounded by cranes with extended arms, lifting containers. Two flying airplanes are shown above the scene, positioned over the ships.

Below this sequence, three horizontal bands of color in different shades of blue are stacked vertically on the left side, serving as a key or legend. Dashed vertical lines extend from the top of the image to the bottom, aligning with the central elements, suggesting separation or different supply chain segments. 

Overall, the elements are evenly spaced, representing a mix of transport modalities and supply chain infrastructure elements across the diagram.
