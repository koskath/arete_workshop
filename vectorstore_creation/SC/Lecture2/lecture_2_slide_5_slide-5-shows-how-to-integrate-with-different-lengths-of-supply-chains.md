# Slide 5 of Lecture 2 contains information about Slide 5 shows how to integrate with different lengths of supply chains.
This diagram builds on the previous Order-to-Payment Flow but now shows three different supply chain configurations overlaid on the same process structure.
The blue loop represents a "long" engineered-to-order supply chain, which extends all the way back to the supplier side. This path shows the order penetrating deep into the procurement and production processes before fulfillment begins.
The red loop shows a "medium" made-to-order supply chain, which penetrates to a middle point in the process. The customer order triggers activities partway through the procurement/production phase.
The shortest path, labeled as "short" delivered from stock, shows fulfillment happening directly from inventory on the customer side without penetrating back into production or sourcing activities.
Each colored loop illustrates a different customer order decoupling point - the point in the supply chain where customer-specific orders begin to drive activities. The longer loops mean more customization but also longer lead times, while shorter loops mean faster delivery from pre-made stock.
The diagram poses questions about determining optimal complexity and identifying the best customer penetration point, suggesting these are strategic decisions companies must make based on their business model and customer requirements.


1. „short“ delivered from stock ‐S
2. „medium“ made to order ‐S
3. „long“ engineered to order‐S
Question: how to determine „optimal complexity“ and the optimal „customer penetration point“?
