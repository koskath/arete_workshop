# Slide 61 of Lecture 2 contains information about DAT – Delivered At Terminal Seller Buyer
# The image in slide 61 of lecture 2 depicts a stylized logistics and transportation network diagram arranged horizontally:
 At the bottom left, there is a factory with a chimney and three vertical windows, accompanied by stacks of rectangular goods on pallets. To the right, a truck carries similar stacked goods. A train with two carriages follows, loaded with containers.

Moving further right, there is a gas station with a canopy, beside which another truck is pictured. Adjacent to the station is a house-like structure with three square windows and a circular sign. The sign features a short vertical line at the bottom.

Next, two large cranes with hooks hang containers over two ships docked side by side. Each vessel displays an anchor symbol on its side and carries piled containers on deck. Continuing to the right, a similar setup with cranes, containers, a warehouse-like building, and another truck and train arrangement is apparent.

Above the entire sequence are three airplanes evenly spaced, facing right. Two cargo ships with containers are placed above the surface level separately, at both ends of the diagram. The first ship is situated above the left section, and the second is near the right.

Vertically from top to bottom, dashed lines connect downwards through each element, aligning with distinct objects from the airplanes to the structures on the ground. Near the lower left corner, there are four horizontal bars in varying shades of blue, ordered from darkest at the top to lightest at the bottom. Each bar appears unlabelled, with no accompanying text.
