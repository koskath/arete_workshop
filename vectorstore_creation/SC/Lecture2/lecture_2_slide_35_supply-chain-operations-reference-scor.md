# Slide 35 of Lecture 2 contains information about Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR)
The Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model, shown here only for illustration purposes, was developed by the Supply Chain Council (SCC). The SCC is an independent, not-for-profit corporation organised in 1996 by the global management-consulting firm Pittiglio Rabin Todd & McGrath (PRTM) and the market research firm Advanced Manufacturing Research (AMR) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It started with 69 voluntary companies and now has more than 1000 members.

The SCC’s objective was to develop a standard supply-chain process reference model enabling effective communication among supply chain partners, by using standard terminology to better communicate and learn about supply chain issues and by using standard metrics to compare and measure performance.
