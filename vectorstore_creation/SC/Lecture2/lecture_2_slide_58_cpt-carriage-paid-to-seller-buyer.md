# Slide 58 of Lecture 2 contains information about CPT – Carriage paid to Seller Buyer
# The image in slide 58 of lecture 2 shows a schematic representation of a supply chain:
The top portion features silhouettes of transportation modes. Three airplanes are evenly spaced across the top of the image. Below each plane, there is a cargo ship with containers. The ships have anchors drawn on their hulls, and containers are stacked on deck.

On the ground level, starting from the left:

1. **Factory:** There is a factory building on the far left with three smokestacks, two windows, and two rectangular structures beside it.
   
2. **Truck and Containers:** Next to the factory, a truck pulls a trailer loaded with containers. Adjacent to it, three stacked groups of containers are visible.

3. **Gas Station:** Further right is a fuel station with a canopy and a fuel pump. Beside the gas station are more stacked containers.

4. **Checkpoint:** A small building with a stop sign and a checkpoint barrier follows the gas station. More containers are seen next to it.

5. **Port with Cranes:** The middle section features a port setting. Two large ships, similar to those above in the air, are docked. Each ship is positioned between two cranes, which are lifting containers with visible hooks.

6. **Warehouse:** To the right of the port, there is a building resembling a warehouse, with stacked containers beside it.

7. **More Containers and Truck:** Another stack of containers is positioned beside a warehouse-like structure, followed by a truck similar to the one near the first factory. This truck also pulls a trailer loaded with containers.

8. **Second Factory:** On the extreme right, another factory building is present. It has multiple windows and a jagged roofline.

Below the entire scene, dashed vertical lines extend from each main component downwards, dividing the scene into segments. On the bottom left corner, three horizontal bars are stacked, each in varying shades of blue, but not labeled.

This setup visually represents different components involved in a logistical supply chain process from production to transportation and storage.
