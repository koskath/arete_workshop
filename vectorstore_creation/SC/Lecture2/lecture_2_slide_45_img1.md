# Slide 45 of Lecture 2 contains information about The diagram in slide 45 of lecture 2 depicts the export order management process as a complex multi-layered system.
On the left side, a vertical bar labeled "COMPLEX PROCESS" indicates the overall complexity of the integrated workflow. The upper tier shows the Purchasing process consisting of two sequential stages with green-highlighted bases, connected to a Forecasting stage also with a green base. Horizontal arrows flow from right to left across the top, indicating the directional flow of planning activities. The lower tier presents the Sourcing process with multiple stages featuring blue-highlighted bases, which extends into the Procurement/Production process containing several additional blue-based stages. This operational tier demonstrates a longer sequential chain of activities. Curved connecting arrows link the upper planning tier with the lower operational tier, illustrating the interdependencies between forecasting, purchasing, sourcing, and procurement/production functions. Additional arrows along the bottom flow from right to left, creating feedback loops that connect the end of the process back to earlier stages. The entire structure reveals a cyclical, interconnected system where planning activities inform operational execution while operational outcomes feed back into planning decisions.
