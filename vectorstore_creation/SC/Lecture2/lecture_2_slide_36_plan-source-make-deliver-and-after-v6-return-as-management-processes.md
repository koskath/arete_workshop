# Slide 36 of Lecture 2 contains information about Plan, Source, Make & Deliver (and after V6 Return) as Management Processes
# The image in slide 36 of lecture 2 shows a structured diagram titled "SCOR is Based on Five Distinct Management Processes" at the top:
Below this title, the diagram is organized into three main sections representing different levels of a supply chain: "Suppliers' Supplier," "Your Company," and "Customer's Customer," from left to right.

1. **Suppliers' Supplier**:
   - This section includes a vertical sequence of processes:
     - A white oval labeled "Plan" is at the top.
     - Below "Plan," a blue arrow points upward, labeled "Plan."
     - Below the arrow, horizontally arranged are five overlapping ovals labeled as follows:
       - "Source" on the leftmost oval.
       - "Make" in the next oval to the right.
       - "Deliver" in the next oval.
       - "Return" in subsequent ovals below each of the above three, connected with lines. 

2. **Your Company**:
   - This section features a larger blue background with upward-pointing curves and blue arrow labeled "Plan" at the top:
     - Central larger white oval labeled "Plan" is connected to three overlapping larger ovals below, labeled:
       - "Source" (left),
       - "Make" (middle and largest),
       - "Deliver" (right).
     - All three have overlapping ovals labeled "Return" below them. 

3. **Customer's Customer**:
   - Similar to the "Suppliers' Supplier" section:
     - At the top is a white oval labeled "Plan."
     - A blue arrow pointing upward, labeled "Plan," is below this oval.
     - Below the arrow, five overlapping ovals labeled:
       - "Source," "Make," "Deliver" (horizontally arranged),
       - "Return" ovals below each of these three, connected with lines.

In between each main section are dashed vertical lines separating:
  - "Suppliers' Supplier" and "Supplier" labeled "Internal or External."
  - "Customer" and "Customer’s Customer" labeled "Internal or External."

Along the bottom:
- "Supplier" is labeled below "Suppliers' Supplier."
- "Your Company" is below the middle section.
- "Customer" and "Customer’s Customer" below the right section.
