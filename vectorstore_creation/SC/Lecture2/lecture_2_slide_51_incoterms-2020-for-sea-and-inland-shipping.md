# Slide 51 of Lecture 2 contains information about Incoterms 2020 for sea and inland shipping

# The graph in slide 51 of lecture 2 has the following Structure:

A horizontal supply chain flow from Seller (left) to Buyer (right)
Icons showing: Seller building → Cargo terminal → Customs → Two ships → Customs → Cargo terminal → Buyer building
A ship icon on the left margin

Four Incoterms displayed (FAS, FOB, CFR, CIF) with horizontal bars showing:
Each term has two rows:

Risks (top bar)
Costs (bottom bar)

Color coding:

Light teal/mint green bars = Seller's responsibility
Dark blue bars = Buyer's responsibility

Specific observations:

FAS (Free Alongside Ship): The green bars are shortest; they end very early in the journey
FOB (Free On Board): Green bars extend slightly further than FAS
CFR (Cost and Freight): The green RISK bar is similar to FOB, but the green COST bar extends much further (past the ships to near customs/cargo terminal on the right)
CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight): Similar to CFR, with an additional small green box labeled "Insurance" appearing in the middle section

Key pattern: As you move down from FAS to CIF, the seller takes on more cost responsibility (green extends further right), while risk transfer points remain relatively similar for FOB/CFR/CIF.
