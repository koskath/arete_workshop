# The diagram in slide 31 of lecture 2 illustrates a two-tier automotive supply chain structure.
At Tier 2, multiple family suppliers (Family 1, Family 2, Family 3, and Family 10 Supplier) provide components to a Tier 1 supplier specializing in cockpits. These Tier 2 suppliers are connected to the Tier 1 cockpit supplier through supply relationships. The Tier 1 supplier then maintains a bidirectional relationship with an Automotive OEM Assembly Plant. Blue arrows indicate physical and information flows occurring between the Family 10 Supplier and the Tier 1 cockpit supplier, as well as between the Tier 1 supplier and the Assembly Plant, demonstrating the integrated nature of material movement and data exchange throughout this multi-tier supply network.
