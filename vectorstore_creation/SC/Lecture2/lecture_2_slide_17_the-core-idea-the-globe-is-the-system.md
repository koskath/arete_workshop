# Slide 17 of Lecture 2 contains information about The Core Idea – The globe is the system
# The image 1 in slide 17 of lecture 2 contains multiple intersecting geometric shapes and annotated points:

1. **Central Triangle**: A large, bold triangle is situated in the middle. The vertices of the triangle are labeled as \( M_1 \), \( M_2 \), and \( K \).
   
2. **Inner Points and Lines**:
   - Point \( P \) is located inside the triangle, closer to the base formed by \( M_1 \) and \( K \).
   - Points \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) are also inside the triangle, positioned near the midsection of each sides extending from \( M_1 \) to \( M_2 \). 

3. **Outer Structure**:
   - A bold, dashed elliptical or oval shape surrounds the triangle. The dash pattern consists of alternating long dashes and smaller spaces.
   - The dashed line intersects with the triangle's vertices \( M_1 \) and \( K \) and passes near \( M_2 \).

4. **Number Annotations**: 
   - The dashed line is labeled with the number “1” at intervals along its path, indicating segments.
   - Another smaller loop section at the top contains the label "2".

5. **Curved Lines**: 
   - A series of thin, arcing curves cover most of the area inside and outside of the triangle. These curves appear to be part of concentric circles or ellipses, overlapping with each other.
   - The curves intersect at multiple points, creating a network of intersections throughout the image.

6. **Orientation and Overlap**:
   - The largest dashed oval shape encompasses and intersects all elements within it, suggesting it serves as a boundary or contour line.
   - The geometric center and overlaps form a complex pattern of circles within and around the triangle.

No indications suggest any other visual elements outside of those described.


# The image 2 in slide 17 of lecture 2  shows a three-dimensional diagram resembling a circular table supported by a central, cylindrical pedestal:
The circular surface serves as a map of the United States, illustrating state boundaries with minimal detail.

Four points are marked and connected with bold, straight lines converging towards the center labeled "Plant location":
1. In the northeast section labeled "Market."
2. In the northwest section labeled "Raw material 1."
3. In the southwest section labeled "Raw material 2."
4. In the southeast section labeled "Raw material 3."

Each of the three "Raw material" points is represented with a cylindrical object and is visually supported by thin vertical lines suggesting elevation from the table's surface. The "Market" and "Raw materials" labels are positioned close to their respective points outside the table surface.

The diagram foregrounds a broader concept of logistics and supply chain management, depicted with vectors symbolizing routes to a strategic "Plant location." The map and connectors are positioned above and parallel to the cylindrical base of the structure, which is shadowed to suggest solidity and depth.
