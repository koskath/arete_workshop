# Slide 62 of Lecture 2 contains information about DDP – Delivered Duty Paid Seller Buyer
# The image in slide 62 of lecture 2 depicts a simplified supply chain network with various transportation and logistics elements arranged horizontally across the image:
At the top, there are three airplanes, each depicted flying over different sections of the image. Below the planes, there are two cargo ships, each carrying several containers arranged in rows on their decks. The ships are positioned above the waterline and are sailing towards the center.

On the far left is a factory building with a smokestack, followed by various transport vehicles, including a truck with containers on a trailer and a railway train with carriages carrying containers. A filling station with a shelter is positioned next in the sequence.

Central in the image are two large ship-docking ports with cranes. Both cranes are actively lifting containers, and there are several stacks of containers on the docks. Two ships, one on each side of the central port area, are positioned under these cranes.

Moving further right, another filling station and a smaller logistics building, possibly a warehouse, appear. Nearby, another truck and train with containers are visible.

On the far right, there is another factory building, taller than the first, with a few windows prominently visible. The space beneath the elements is sectioned off with vertical dotted lines extending downward, potentially indicating different stages or steps in the process.

At the bottom left, there are three horizontal color-coded bars with varying shades of blue, possibly representing different categories, stages, or processes in the supply chain, but without any accompanying text or labels.

Overall, the image arranges visual symbols of various logistics and supply chain components in a linear fashion to represent movement and storage phases from production (factories) through various logistics and transportation methods (planes, ships, trucks, and trains) to distribution centers or end locations.
