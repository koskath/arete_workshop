# Slide 9 of Lecture 2 contains information about Also different levels – Supply Chain, Company and Process level
There are also different levels to consider: supply chain level, company level and process level. It is no longer all about technology, warehouses, distribution centres, trucks or planes.

At the supply chain level (a global view), the supply chain is any combination of processes, functions, activities, relationships and pathways along which products, services, information and financial transactions move in and between enterprises. At the company level (an individual view, see Gattorna 2006), supply chain management focuses on the integration and coordination of all activities associated with the financial, material and information flows through improved supply chain relations to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. At the process level, these flows are translated into specific activities and processes (Monczka/Trent/Handfield, 2002).
