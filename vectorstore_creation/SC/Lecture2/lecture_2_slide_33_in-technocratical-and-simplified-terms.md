# Slide 33 of Lecture 2 contains information about In technocratical and „simplified“ Terms
In technocratic and simplified terms, we can think of systems in terms of structure, function, process and environment. **Structure** refers to the boundary, elements, subsystems and interfaces (input/output) of the system, and to the super system (rank = +1). **Function** is related to the purpose of the system – what it is supposed to do at the system level (rank = 0). **Process** describes how the structure is actually combined and applied to fulfil the function.

The **environment** consists of elements outside the boundaries that nonetheless affect the system, including the super system. Sub-systems (rank = −1) interact via inputs and outputs to deliver the overall function.
