# Slide 21 of Lecture 2 contains information about Logistics is driver of the development “shrinking the world”

# The image in slide 21 of lecture 2 illustrates how advances in logistics and transportation have progressively "shrunk" the world by reducing travel times and distances.
On the left side, a globe shows transportation routes with text indicating the evolution of transportation speeds across different eras. From 1500-1840, horse-drawn coaches and sailing ships averaged only 10 mph. The period 1850-1930 saw steam locomotives reaching 65 mph and steam ships 36 mph. The 1950s brought propeller planes averaging 400 mph, and by the 1960s, jets were flying at 500 to 700 mph.
The right side displays a timeline chart divided into three transportation modes across four time periods (17th-18th Century, 19th Century, 20th Century, and 21st Century).
The Air row shows progression from basic airports to global mobility systems, with increasing reach indicated by the expanding blue bar.
The Land row (in yellow-green) shows evolution from canals providing punctual inland access, to railways enabling inland and national accessibility, to highways supporting national mobility systems. Historical images illustrate each phase.
The Maritime row (in blue) displays the transition from sailships supporting empires and global trade networks, to steamships facilitating international trade and mobility, to containerships enabling global distribution systems. Each phase is illustrated with period-appropriate vessel images.
The overall visualization demonstrates how each technological advancement compressed time and distance, making the world functionally smaller and more interconnected.
