# Slide 38 of Lecture 2 contains information about What is the scope of the Supply Chain – who is in, where are the nodes (actors, locations) in the net

# The diagram in slide 38 of lecture 2 depicts a global supply chain network mapped across multiple continents, illustrating the geographic distribution of actors and nodes:
A legend identifies key components including consumers, suppliers, warehouses, production sites, return flows, and execution processes. The network spans from North America to Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Oceania. Multiple consumer nodes (S1) are positioned across various regions with associated service relationships (SR1, SR3). Several warehouse facilities (S1, D1) are strategically located with various distribution and service configurations (SR1, DR1, DR3). A central manufacturing hub (S1, S2, M1, D1) operates in Asia with connections to multiple service and distribution channels (SR1, SR3, DR3). Latin American suppliers (D1) and other suppliers (D1) feed into the network from their respective regions. A European supplier (D2) with distribution capabilities (DR1) connects to European consumers (S1) with service relationships (SR1, SR3). Execution process arrows traverse the global map, connecting these various nodes and demonstrating the flow of materials, information, and returns across the international supply chain network. The configuration reveals a complex multi-regional structure with interdependent relationships between manufacturing, distribution, and consumption points distributed strategically across continents.
