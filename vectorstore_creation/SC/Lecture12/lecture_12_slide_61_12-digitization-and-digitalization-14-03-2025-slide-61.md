# Slide 61 of Lecture 12 contains information about The image in slide 61 of lecture 12 consists of several elements arranged in a structured format, as follows:

1. **Top Section:**
   - A dark blue horizontal banner with white text stating: "Internet of Things (IoT) collects and analyses data to deliver actionable insights and improve decision accuracy."

2. **Main Diagram:**
   - **Left Column:**
     - Titled "Sensor networks: in the field, on animals or on equipment."
     - Contains a dashed-line box with seven yellow squares, each containing a different black icon:
       1. A wind turbine.
       2. A monitor displaying a waveform.
       3. A tractor.
       4. A screen with a plant icon.
       5. A cow.
       6. Wheat plants.
       7. A plant in soil.

   - **Center:**
     - Three main components connected by arrows:
       - **Cloud-based services:** A cloud icon with arrows pointing to and from a smartphone and an analytics icon.
       - **User Interface:** A smartphone icon with two-way arrows to cloud and analytics.
       - **Analytics:** Compass icon with arrows pointing to cloud and user interface.

   - **Right Column:**
     - Titled "IoT in agriculture" and contains a list in a grey box:
       1. "Weather: rain, humidity, sunshine"
       2. "GPS, auto-steer, heads-up-display"
       3. "Real-time yield analysis"
       4. "GPS tracking, moisture, soil uniform grid-sampling"
       5. "Livestock wearables: health, breeding, nutrition"
       6. "Crop health, variable rate seeding, variable rate nutrient and protection application"
       7. "Soil qualities: nutrients, moisture, organic matter, etc."

3. **Bottom Section:**
   - A grey box labeled "Field heat-maps: yield, nutrients, soil quality, moisture, etc." with an arrow pointing to a heat-map image.
   - The heat-map image: Rectangular with irregular red and green patterns.

4. **Bottom Text Block:**
   - A sentence, "Internet of Things analysis with sensor networks allow producers to gather data in real time and generate usable, insightful analyses to help make for crop and decisions about the timing and intensity of protection and nutrition activities for both crop and livestock operations."

5. **Source Information:**
   - "Source: EY analysis" printed in bold at the bottom-left corner.

The layout uses lines and arrows to indicate relationships between the elements, emphasizing the interconnected nature of IoT components and their application in agriculture.
