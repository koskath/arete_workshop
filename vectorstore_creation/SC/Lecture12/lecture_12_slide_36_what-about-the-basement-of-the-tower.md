# Slide 36 of Lecture 12 contains information about What about the basement of the tower?

# The image in slide 36 of lecture 12 is a circular diagram with a central section labeled "Command Center," depicted with a red, cylindrical tower icon. The diagram is divided into two halves labeled "Supply" on the left and "Demand" on the right, marked by a green outer ring surrounding the circle.

**Supply Side (Left Half):**
1. **Contract Manufacturers:** Positioned on the periphery, represented by a factory icon within a circle.
2. **Regional Distribution Center:** Next to "Contract Manufacturers," shown as a warehouse icon within a circle.
3. **ODM:** Adjacent to "Regional Distribution Center," depicted with a different building icon within a circle.

These elements are connected to the "Command Center" by thin lines, showing a network structure. 

**Demand Side (Right Half):**
1. **Distributor:** Located directly opposite "Contract Manufacturers," depicted with a building icon representing a distribution center within a circle.
2. **Regional Merge Center:** Next to "Distributor," shown by a building and several arrows to indicate merging activities, within a circle.
3. **Retailer:** Located beside "Regional Merge Center," represented by a storefront icon within a circle.
4. **Customer:** Positioned at the end of the right half, depicted with two people icons, indicating end consumers, within a circle.

**Additional Elements:**
- The words "Adaptive Business Network Platform" are placed around the "Command Center."
- All peripheral entities are linked radially to the central "Command Center" with connecting lines, forming a radial network.
- The gray background underlines the circular setup, differentiating it from the green "Supply" and "Demand" border.

This layout illustrates a business network where the central "Command Center" manages connections between different supply and demand entities.
