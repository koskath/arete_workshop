# Slide 19 of Lecture 12 contains information about The image in slide 19 of lecture 12 is an octagonal diagram with a blue diamond shape at the center, containing the text:

- "R/3" in large white letters.
- Below it are the words "Client / Server" and "ABAP/4" in smaller white letters, stacked vertically.

Surrounding the central diamond, there are eight trapezoidal segments, each corresponding to a specific module or area, color-coded and labeled:

1. Top-left, green trapezoid labeled "SD" with yellow text "Sales & Distribution."
2. Left-center, green trapezoid labeled "MM" with yellow text "Materials Mgmt."
3. Bottom-left, green trapezoid labeled "PP" with yellow text "Production Planning."
4. Bottom-left corner, green trapezoid labeled "QM" with yellow text "Quality Mgmt."
5. Bottom-center, green trapezoid labeled "PM" with yellow text "Plant Maint."
6. Bottom-right corner, yellow trapezoid labeled "HR" with black text "Human Resource."
7. Bottom-right, green trapezoid labeled "PS" with yellow text "Project System."
8. Right-center, green trapezoid labeled "WF" with yellow text "Workflow."
9. Top-right, red trapezoid labeled "FI" with yellow text "Financial Accounting."
10. Top-center, red trapezoid labeled "CO" with yellow text "Controlling."
11. Top-right end, red trapezoid labeled "AM" with yellow text "Fixed Assets Mgmt."

Additionally, overlapping the right-center trapezoid, there is a small light gray trapezoid with black text "IS" and under it, "Industry Solutions."

Surrounding the entire central structure, a series of interconnected 3D rhombus shapes are arranged in a circular pattern, forming a lattice-like network in blue lines, creating a frame around the modules.
