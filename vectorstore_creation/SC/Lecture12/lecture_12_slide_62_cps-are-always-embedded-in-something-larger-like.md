# Description of the Graph ins lide 62 of lecture 12: CPS in the Context of the Internet of Things (IoT)

The diagram explains how **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)** are embedded into larger ecosystems—specifically the **Internet of Things (IoT)**—and how they generate value across their entire life cycle. It visualizes the relationship between “things,” their smart components, users, needs, and solution providers.

# 1. Life Cycle of a Cyber-Physical System (Left Side)

On the left, a circular life-cycle diagram shows:

### **“Thing” vs. “Smart”**
- The **orange “thing”** represents the physical component (e.g., a machine, device, vehicle).
- The **green “smart”** part represents digital features:
  - sensors  
  - processors  
  - connectivity  
  - embedded intelligence  

Together, they form a **Cyber-Physical System (CPS)**.

### **Life Cycle Stages**
- **Birth** — the product is created.  
- **End of life** — the product is retired or recycled.  

The CPS evolves from being a simple “thing” into a “smart” object that interacts with digital environments.

# 2. Needs Along the Life Cycle Process (Center)

A user icon approaches the CPS life cycle.  
This represents **user needs** that arise at different times during the product’s use:

- operation  
- maintenance  
- optimization  
- service  
- upgrades  
- end-of-life management  

These needs shape how the CPS must communicate, respond, and interact through the IoT infrastructure.

# 3. Solutions (Bottom Path)

A layered path shows **solutions provided along the product’s life cycle**.

Key idea:
- Multiple **solution providers** deliver different services enabled by CPS and IoT technologies.  
- These solutions depend on:
  - data from the CPS  
  - internet connectivity  
  - analytics  
  - interoperability between products and platforms  

The path eventually leads to a **solution provider** icon, symbolizing companies delivering services such as:
- remote diagnostics  
- predictive maintenance  
- fleet management  
- software updates  
- optimization algorithms

# 4. The IoT Definition (Right Side Box)

A text box defines IoT in context:

> “The Internet of things IoT could be understood as the continuum of user-oriented problem solutions which are incorporating internet technologies as well as Cyber-Physical Systems.”

Key message:
- IoT is not just about connected devices but about **user-centered solutions** created by combining:
  - physical objects  
  - embedded intelligence  
  - networking technologies  
  - cloud services

# 5. Overall Meaning of the Graph

The diagram illustrates that:

### **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) do not exist in isolation.**
They are part of a **larger IoT ecosystem** that:

- supports the full life cycle of “smart + physical” products  
- links users, devices, and solution providers  
- enables continuous service delivery  
- creates new digital business models  
- integrates physical processes with digital infrastructure  

CPS act as the **core building blocks** of the Internet of Things, generating data and enabling services across the entire life cycle of a product.
