# Slide 27 of Lecture 12 contains information about Overcoming the time funnel by a changed planning logic Better „muddling through“ in a sequence of “not perfect” plans than relying on one perfect but quickly obsolete plan

The slide illustrates a fundamental shift in supply chain planning philosophy by comparing two approaches through timeline diagrams. The core issue being addressed is the "time funnel" problem, where plans become obsolete before they can be fully executed.

In the old planning logic shown on the left, the planning level operates on a single, extended planning cycle marked as "P". This long planning horizon creates a significant gap between when plans are made and when they are executed. At the execution level, multiple intervention cycles (marked as "Ic") occur sequentially. The critical weakness appears when a "New Plan" is introduced partway through execution, forcing a complete restart of the planning process and disrupting the ongoing intervention cycles.

The new planning logic on the right demonstrates a dramatically different approach. Instead of one long planning cycle, the planning level now contains multiple shorter planning cycles, each marked with "P". These frequent planning iterations enable "pointed" changes to the plan rather than wholesale replacements. At the execution level, the intervention cycles continue, but they are now synchronized with regular plan updates (marked as "Upd. Plan") that flow down from each planning cycle above.

The essential transformation is moving from infrequent, disruptive planning events to continuous, incremental plan adjustments. Rather than creating a perfect plan that quickly becomes outdated, the new approach embraces a series of "not perfect" plans that remain relevant through constant refinement. Each updated plan incorporates new information and adjusts to changing conditions without derailing execution momentum. This creates a more responsive system where planning and execution work in harmony rather than in conflict, ultimately overcoming the time funnel where plans lose their validity faster than they can be implemented.
