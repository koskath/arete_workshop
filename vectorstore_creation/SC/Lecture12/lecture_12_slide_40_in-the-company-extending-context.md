# Slide 40 of Lecture 12 contains information about In the company extending context- Supply Chain Event Management –
Supply Chain Event Management focuses on monitoring and getting real-time status data across companies along the supply chain (e.g. status of stocks, orders, shipments, production) in order to “align instead of central control”. This real-time data is compared with projected standard processes (business rules), which generates events representing deviations, including both planned and unplanned events. A notification component escalates events, ideally always addressing those responsible in each case. A solution component (simulation) supports the search for problem-solving alternatives, while a control component evaluates the effects of the desired action on the remaining supply chain process. Finally, identification, documentation and key performance indicators (KPIs) of the extended supply chain serve as the measurement dimension.
