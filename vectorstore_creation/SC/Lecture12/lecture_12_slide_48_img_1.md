# The image 1 in slide 48 of lecture 12 contains:

On the left side is the rectangular box, oriented horizontally with its longer sides parallel to the bottom edge of the image. It has a protruding circular section on the bottom left corner. The box features several printed elements: the top has a logo consisting of a stylized lowercase “i” inside a square, followed by the text “IDENT-I” in bold letters. Below this, there is a graphic of a crosshair with several concentric circles. Beneath the graphic, the text reads “IMC-40-3.6K” and “Part No. 236456 Made in Canada.”

To the right of the box are several cylindrical objects. These objects vary in size and are arranged in increasing order of size from left to right. Starting from the left:

1. A small cylinder with the number “1” visible on its top.
2. A slightly larger cylinder, with two vertical lines visible on the top that form a capital "T."
3. Another similar-sized cylinder with a faintly visible logo consisting of a lowercase “i” followed by text that is not clearly legible in the image.
4. A larger cylinder with text on the top that reads "AMPEL-BKG" along the upper edge, below it is the alphanumeric "SPC-60," and the text "Made in U.S.A."
5. The largest cylinder on this row is marked with "AMPEL-FUSE" along the top edge, "ICC-30" below it, and "Made in U.S.A." towards the bottom.

Behind these cylinders is another cylindrical object with a larger diameter, resembling a disc or puck. It has text along the sides: "AMPEL-FUSE," "ICC-30," and "Made in U.S.A." The top is marked with a circular indentation at the center that might be a hole or depression.

Overall, the objects show varying levels of detail, mainly consisting of small print and logos. The arrangement suggests a display of related products, possibly parts or components.
