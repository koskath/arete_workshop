# Slide 58 of Lecture 12 contains information about Würth uses smart containers in order to optimize C-Parts management processes in industry Examples for CPS in the real world
Würth uses smart containers in order to optimize C-parts management processes in industry, providing further examples of CPS in the real world. Embedded microelectronics are used for monitoring the filling level of containers, and the functions of the „iBin“ include imaging the interior using a miniaturized camera, calculating the filling level based on image processing algorithms and generating a business event in case of a level below the limit. In addition, wireless networking and communication with the environment enable fully automated and highly efficient C-parts management as a service.
