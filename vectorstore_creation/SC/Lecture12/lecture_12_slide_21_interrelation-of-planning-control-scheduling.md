# Slide 21 of Lecture 12 contains information about Interrelation of Planning, Control, Scheduling –> „Philosophies“

# The graph in slide 21 of lecture 12 displays a Horizontal Process Flow:
Sequential flow across four main stages:
- **Planning** → **Dispatching Scheduling** → **Control** → **Phys. Flow**

## Dimensional Analysis Across Process Stages

### Time Frame
- **Planning**: "long run", "anticipating"
- **Dispatching Scheduling**: "short run"
- **Control**: "simultaneous"
- **Phys. Flow**: "simultaneous"

### Hierarchical Position
- **Planning**: "high – top down"
- **Dispatching Scheduling**: (Transition level)
- **Control**: "middle"
- **Phys. Flow**: "shop floor"

### Critical Element
- **Planning**: "Handle Uncertainty"
- **Dispatching Scheduling**: "Select from Alternatives"
- **Control**: "phys./technological determined"
- **Phys. Flow**: (Physical constraints apply)

### Solution By
- **Planning**: "Collecting Info", Setting premises, Building scenarios"
- **Dispatching Scheduling**: (Selection process)
- **Control**: "calculating Optima"
- **Phys. Flow**: "Applying rules"

### Types of Info., Data Needed and Applied
- **Planning**: Historical data, patterns; Forecasts, parameters; Context Information
- **Dispatching Scheduling**: "Situative" data; Capacities, lead-times
- **Control**: Real-time data, Events, disturbances, "Triggers"
- **Phys. Flow**: Real-time data, Events, disturbances, "Triggers"

## Supply Chain Integration Layers (Bottom)
Three interconnected phases spanning the process stages:
- **Supply Chain Configuration** (Orange - aligns with Planning)
- **Supply Chain Planning** (Orange - spans Planning through Control)
- **Supply Chain Execution** (Orange - aligns with Control and Phys. Flow)

## Key Flow Characteristics
- **Left to Right**: Progression from strategic to operational
- **Top to Bottom**: Hierarchy from corporate level to shop floor
- **Time Horizon**: Decreases from long-term planning to real-time execution
- **Flexibility**: Decreases from scenario-based to rule-based approaches
- **Data Type**: Evolves from historical/forecast to real-time/event-driven
