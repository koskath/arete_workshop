This visual emphasizes the interaction between traditional barcode systems and advanced smart object technologies, such as RFID.

In supply chain analytics, barcodes and RFID tags serve as essential tools for inventory management and tracking. Barcodes require line-of-sight for scanning, making them ideal for straightforward, manual processes where each item is scanned individually. RFID, representing smart object technology, allows for wireless, bulk reading of tags without direct line-of-sight, enabling faster data collection and real-time tracking.

This distinction affects supply chain analytics by influencing the speed and accuracy of data acquisition, which in turn enhances the real-time visibility and traceability of products throughout the supply chain. RFID technology supports more advanced analytics due to its ability to collect large volumes of data quickly, improving inventory management, reducing errors, and optimizing logistics.
