# Slide 25 of Lecture 12 contains information about From ERP to Advanced Planning Systems
Why are Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems often not (longer) sufficient? They are typically based on a top-down, sequential design logic for strategic decisions, with no consideration of interactions, and with priority usually set on production based on forecasts that are not re-questioned, without trade-offs between sub-functions. As a result, there is little flexibility, and planning runs are time-consuming and complete; planners use plans de facto only as a first orientation and make use of notes or a spreadsheet. Although there may be precise data in the system, the scheduling logic simplifies the constraints, for example through the assumption of unlimited capacity and by relying on average processing times and standard waiting times.
