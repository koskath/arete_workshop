# Slide 8 of Lecture 14 contains information about e.g. Integrating with different length of the chains or the major objectives such as efficiency vs. agility, vs resilience, vs. sustainability …
In this example, we consider how to integrate supply chains of different lengths while pursuing major objectives such as efficiency, agility, resilience and sustainability. At the core, there is an **order flow** that connects **customers or end users** with **suppliers or vendors**, and that encompasses activities like **purchasing**, **forecasting**, **sourcing**, **procurement and production**, the **fulfilment flow** and the **payment flow**. Depending on how this flow is configured, we can distinguish three basic chain lengths: a **“short” chain**, where products are delivered from stock (delivered‑from‑stock, S); a **“medium” chain**, where goods are made to order (made‑to‑order, S); and a **“long” chain**, where products are engineered to order (engineered‑to‑order, S). The central challenge is to determine the **optimal complexity** of the chain and the optimal **customer penetration point**, that is, the point at which customer‑specific requirements start to shape the flow, as illustrated on Slide 8 dated 31.01.2024.

The chart illustrates how supply chains operate at different lengths and levels of complexity, depending on what is being produced and how customer demand is fulfilled. It shows a sequence of core supply chain functions—from suppliers and vendors on the left, through sourcing, procurement, production, forecasting, and order management, to customers and end-users on the right. Several colored flow lines run through this system to represent different fulfillment strategies. A **short, stock-based flow** (red) moves quickly through the chain, indicating products delivered directly from inventory. A **medium-length flow** (gray) represents goods made to order, requiring additional processing time. The **longest flow** (blue) traces engineered-to-order products, which must pass through more stages, from design through production before reaching the customer. Together, these flows visualize the trade-offs that managers face between efficiency, agility, resilience, and sustainability. The diagram emphasizes the challenge of determining the “optimal complexity” of the supply chain and identifying the best “customer penetration point,” meaning the stage at which customer-specific customization begins.
