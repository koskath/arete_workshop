# Slide 17 of Lecture 14 contains information about Broad production location strategies Dicken

The picture illustrates different global production location strategies as described by Dicken (2003). The central graphic is a matrix showing how companies may distribute production across multiple countries depending on their strategic goals. On the left side, the vertical axis contrasts **globally concentrated production** with **product specialization for regional markets**, while the horizontal axis distinguishes between **centralized production** and **vertical integration**. Each colored block in the matrix represents different combinations of these strategic choices, with arrows indicating flows of components, products, or knowledge between locations such as Country A and Country B.
A large red text overlay—“Location strategies go beyond the single location decision”—emphasizes that firms rarely choose only one site; instead, they build interconnected production networks. On the right side, two blue boxes highlight specific strategic patterns: **host-market production**, where production is located close to key consumer markets, and **transnational vertical integration**, where different stages of the value chain are distributed across several countries. The overall image conveys that production decisions involve a complex mix of centralization, specialization, and cross-border coordination rather than choosing one isolated location.
