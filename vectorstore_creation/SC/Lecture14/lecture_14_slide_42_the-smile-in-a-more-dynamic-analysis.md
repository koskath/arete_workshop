# Slide 42 of Lecture 14 contains information about The smile in a more dynamic analysis Spillover effects and catch-up

The image presents a dynamic version of the “smile curve,” showing how value creation along global value chains evolves over time through spillover effects and catch-up processes. The vertical axis represents value added, while the horizontal axis shows the disaggregation of the value chain from inputs toward final markets.
On both ends of the curve, **advanced economies** dominate high-value activities—such as services, intangibles, and innovation—linked to strong R&D knowledge on the left and marketing knowledge on the right. These segments represent areas of **industry creation**, where firms capture the highest value.
In the middle of the curve, **emerging market economies** focus on tangibles and manufacturing, which traditionally generate lower value. However, the diagram highlights that these regions can move upward through **spillover effects**—gains in know-how, technology, and capabilities transferred from advanced economies—and through **catch-up processes**, gradually shifting toward higher-value activities.
Overall, the figure illustrates how global value chains are not static: emerging economies can upgrade their position, and the smile curve itself can flatten or shift as capabilities diffuse across regions.
