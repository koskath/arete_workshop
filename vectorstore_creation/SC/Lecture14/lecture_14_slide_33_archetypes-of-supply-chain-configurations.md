# Slide 33 of Lecture 14 contains information about Supply Chain Configuration Themes

This slide introduces key themes related to understanding and designing supply chain configurations. It highlights the idea of identifying **archetypes of supply chain configurations**, meaning the common structural patterns that appear across different industries. It also references the importance of determining the **push/pull boundary**, the point in the supply chain where activities shift from being forecast-driven (push) to demand-driven (pull). Additionally, the slide mentions **postponement**, a related concept in which final product differentiation is delayed until closer to the customer to increase flexibility and reduce risk.

The larger text at the bottom emphasizes the purpose of the topic: looking for **dominant themes**, identifying **basic patterns**, and understanding distinct **configurations** that help explain how different supply chains operate and how they can be strategically aligned.
