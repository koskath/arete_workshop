# Slide 14 of Lecture 14 contains information about Key learning points: Session 4 Production planning and design
The key learning points for Session 4 focus on **production planning and design**, drawing on both literature and practice. On the **literature** side, Christodoulou, J., Srai, S. and Gregory, M. (2019) discuss “Synergy from configuration of global production networks: drivers, mechanisms, and outcomes” (*Production Planning & Control*, Vol. 30, No. ?, pp. 179–196); Mason‑Jones, R., Naylor, B. and Towill, D. (2000) compare lean, agile and leagile approaches in “Lean, agile or leagile? Matching your supply chain to the marketplace” (*International Journal of Production Research*, Vol. 38, No. 17, pp. 4061–4070); Lee, H. (2004) presents “The Triple‑A Supply Chain” (*Harvard Business Review*, Vol. 82, No. 10, pp. 102–112); and Spear, S. and Bowen, H. K. (1999) decode “the DNA of the Toyota production system” (*Harvard Business Review*, Vol. 77, No. 5, pp. 97–106). On the **content** side, the session covers Operations Management history, the Ship Game with push, Kanban and milestones, basic layout decisions, basic production systems (especially lean management), and global production networks and their configurations, which connect to Lesson 13. The **main issues**, framed under the heading of **flow systems**, are explored through broad questions such as: What are the classic ways of organising production systems? How is the context of manufacturing changing from a flow‑thinking viewpoint? What is lean management, and how is production organised under lean principles and pillars? What are the differences—particularly in context—between Taylor, Ford, lean and agile manufacturing? And, finally, where do we produce different products, and what drives these location and configuration decisions? These points are summarised in Final Wrap Up 21.03.2025 Slide 14.
