# Slide 51 of Lecture 14 contains information about Way more effects than just GHG

The images on this slide illustrate that the environmental impact of global shipping goes far beyond greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The photos show several forms of maritime pollution and operational failures: a vessel emitting dense smoke, containers lost at sea, unstable or collapsing container stacks, and derelict or abandoned ships rusting along coastlines. At the top, a schematic shows how ships discharge wastewater and residues in different loading conditions. Together, these visuals highlight the broader ecological footprint of maritime transport—air pollution, marine debris, hazardous spills, ship scrapping, and operational losses—demonstrating why sustainability in logistics requires addressing far more than CO₂ alone.
