Calculating Cost Factors can be done by comparing a Cost Factor ABC Corp. XYZ Corp. set of numbers. In this
cost factor comparison, the quoted price is $10.00 for ABC Corp. and $12.00 for XYZ Corp., while freight adds
+ $0.19 and + $0.33 respectively. On a per-quantity basis, this corresponds to ($ / qty.) (19 / 100) for ABC Corp.
and (50 / 150) for XYZ Corp. In addition, discounts of -$0.2 and -$0.12 are applied as prompt payment terms,
corresponding to (Prompt payment) (2% of quoted price) for ABC Corp. and (1%) for XYZ Corp.

This slide shows the first step of comparing ABC Corp. and XYZ Corp. using pure cost-related variables. Even though ABC appears cheaper at first glance ($10 per unit vs. XYZ’s $12), the slide breaks down the additional cost elements to reveal the effective per-unit cost.
ABC has lower freight cost per unit because the order size was larger (100 units), whereas XYZ’s freight per unit is higher. Both suppliers offer prompt-payment discounts, but ABC gives a 2% discount while XYZ gives only 1%. After adjusting for freight and discounts, ABC still looks slightly cheaper on a basic cost basis, but this does not yet include delivery reliability, quality, or speed—those factors follow in Results 2.
