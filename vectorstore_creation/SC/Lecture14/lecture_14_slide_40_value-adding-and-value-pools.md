# Slide 40 of Lecture 14 contains information about Value adding and “Value Pools”
The slide presents two visual examples that illustrate how value is created and captured across global supply chains — highlighting the concepts of **value adding** and **value pools**.
On the left, the first image shows the *U.S. bilateral trade balance with China* for a single unit of the iPhone 4. The diagram traces the value of inputs sourced from multiple countries: Korea, Germany, France, Japan, and the Rest of the World (ROW). Each contributes specific component costs that ultimately flow into China, where the final assembly takes place. Although the iPhone is exported from China to the U.S., the graphic emphasizes that China captures only a very small portion of the actual value added. This is reinforced in the table below: while the U.S. shows a large *gross* trade deficit with China (–$169.41), the *value-added* trade deficit attributable specifically to China is just –$6.54. The rest of the value originates from components made in other countries. The red circles and arrows highlight this discrepancy, showing how misleading gross trade figures can be without understanding value creation.
On the right, the second image depicts *the U.S. auto industry’s profit pool*. The bar chart compares different segments of the automotive value chain in terms of operating margin versus revenue share. The visualization shows that the most profitable parts of the industry — such as auto loans, insurance, and after-sales parts — do not necessarily correspond to the segments generating the largest revenues (e.g., vehicle manufacturing). This illustrates the concept of “value pools”: certain activities in a value chain capture disproportionate profit even if they represent a smaller share of total sales. The image highlights how value distribution varies widely across interconnected activities within an industry.
