# Slide 6 of Lecture 14 contains information about Key learning points: Session 1: Introduction to logistics and supply chain management
Literature and content for this session focus on providing both an academic and a practical introduction to logistics and supply chain management. On the **literature** side, Kopczak, L. R. and Johnson, M. Eric (2003), in “The Supply‑Chain Management Effect” (MIT Sloan Management Review, Vol. 44, No. 3, pp. 27–34), and Bowersox, Donald (2007), in “SCM: The Past is Prologue” (CSCMP's Supply Chain Quarterly, 2/2007, pp. 1–7), offer important perspectives on how supply‑chain management has evolved and why it matters. On the **content** side, the session begins with an introduction to the course, followed by a discussion of the evolution of logistics and SCM, a review of key logistics activities and components, and an explanation of the grand purpose of supply chain management. These topics are framed by some broad questions that address the main issues of **SCManagement**, such as: What is logistics and SCM, and what is the difference between them? What does system, flow or network thinking in logistics and SCM mean? How do functional and holistic views differ, and what are the “footprints” of modern logistics and SCM? Finally, the session asks what it really means to “manage” a supply chain, encouraging participants to think about management as applied to entire flows and networks rather than isolated functions, as summarised on 29.02.2024 Slide 6.
