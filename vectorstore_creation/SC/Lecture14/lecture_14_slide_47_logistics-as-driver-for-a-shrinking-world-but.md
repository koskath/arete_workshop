# Slide 47 of Lecture 14 contains information about Logistics as driver for a shrinking world but also increasingly as polluter of this small world

This slide illustrates the dual role of logistics in shaping the modern world. On the left, the collapsing, punctured globe symbolizes how logistics has historically been a **driver of a shrinking world**—reducing distances, accelerating global integration, and enabling international trade from the 1500s through industrialization, containerization, and the rise of global supply chains. However, the cracks spreading across the globe also represent the **negative externalities** of this expansion: pollution, resource depletion, and environmental stress caused by ever-growing transport volumes.
The images on the right reinforce this tension. They show congested ports, oil spills, truck queues, and traffic jams, all visual reminders of how logistics—while indispensable for economic growth—has increasingly become a **major polluter and source of environmental degradation**. Together, the visuals echo the lecture’s message: logistics is not only a force that connects and compresses the world, but also one that contributes significantly to global emissions, accidents, waste, and ecological harm. The challenge going forward is to balance global connectivity with sustainability.
