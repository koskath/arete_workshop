# Slide 18 of Lecture 14 contains information about Key learning points – Session 5
Inventory Management, Planning and Control bring together both content and literature on how inventories are handled in supply chains. In terms of **content**, the session covers EOQ and other inventory management concepts, inventory control systems and approaches, ABC/XYZ classification and supply chain inventory management as a whole. On the **literature** side, Abernathy, F. H., Dunlop, J. T., Hammond, J. H. and Weil, D. (2000), in “Control Your Inventory” (*Harvard Business Review*, Vol. 78, No. 6, pp. 169–176), and Lee, H. and Billington, C. (1992), in “Managing Supply Chain Inventory: Pitfalls and Opportunities” (*Sloan Management Review*, Vol. 33, No. 3, pp. 65–73), provide important insights into how inventory practices can succeed or fail. The **main issues** addressed include the role and function of inventory in the supply chain and the trade‑offs between capacity, service level, lead time and inventory. Furthermore, the session examines major types of control systems for inventories, such as EOQ, safety stock and reordering tactics, and it explores ABC‑analysis and flow analysis (or also XYZ) to develop selective strategies. These topics are framed by several broad questions: **Why do we need inventories, and what types of inventory might exist along a supply chain? How much should we order and when should we order? What are the typical approaches that can be employed for inventory management and control?** All of these points are summarised in Final Wrap Up 21.03.2025 Slide 18.
