# Slide 19 of Lecture 14 contains information about Key decisions about inventory control and stock keeping?
When thinking about key decisions in inventory control and stock keeping, several fundamental questions arise. First, managers must determine the **size of the inventory** and the appropriate **time of stock keeping**, balancing holding costs against service requirements. Second, they need to decide **when to refill** and what will **trigger the refilling decision**, such as reorder points, review periods or specific demand signals. Third, they have to establish **how much to order or reorder** each time, taking into account economies of scale, variability and capacity constraints. Finally, they must decide **how many inventory points** there should be in the chain, which affects both responsiveness and total cost. These decisions are central to Strategy & Configuration 28.05.2019 (Slide 19).
The pictures on the slide illustrate two typical forms of inventory storage.  
The top image shows palletized goods stored in a warehouse, representing traditional indoor stock keeping of packaged materials.  
The bottom image shows large outdoor silos, which are used for bulk storage of raw materials such as grains, powders, or liquids. Together, the images highlight that inventory can take many physical forms depending on the product and supply chain design.
