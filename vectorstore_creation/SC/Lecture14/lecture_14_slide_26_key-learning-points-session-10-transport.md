# Slide 26 of Lecture 14 contains information about Key learning points: Session 10: Transport and Logistics Services in Supply Chains
In Session 10, the key learning points on transport and logistics services in supply chains are organised around both content and literature. On the **content** side, the session covers transport services, the characteristics of different transport modes, the efficiency of transport services, and multimodal, intermodal and combined transport. It also examines transport mode selection using the Belt‑Road‑Initiative (BRI) as an example, discusses a case study by Prockl, G. and Weibrecht, K. on “Missing Boxes in Central Europe”, reviews recent developments in times of COVID‑19, and introduces logistics service providers such as freight forwarders, 3PL and 4PL operators. On the **literature** side, Stalk, G. (2009), in “The Threat of Global Gridlock” (*Harvard Business Review*, July–August 2009, pp. 126–129), provides an important perspective on congestion and capacity issues. The **main issues** addressed include understanding cost structures and operating characteristics of the different transport modes, modal choice and carrier selection, and the organisation of hinterland transports of containers. These themes lead to broad questions that address the main issues: **What are the criteria to select a mode of transportation? What are the elements and actors of a transportation system?** Together, these questions frame the discussion in Final Wrap Up 21.03.2025 Slide 26.
