# Slide 41 of Lecture 14 contains information about Value creation E.g. for the case of the iPhone

The image illustrates how value is created along the disaggregated value chain of the iPhone using a “smile curve” representation. The vertical axis shows value added, while the horizontal axis moves from early-stage inputs toward the final market. At the left side of the curve, high value is generated through **R&D knowledge**, driven mainly by Apple (US), which handles basic and applied research, product design, and commercialization. Further along the chain, specialist firms contribute components with varying levels of value creation, such as ARM Holdings (UK) for chip design, Balda (Germany) for touchscreen parts, Samsung (Korea) and NXP (Netherlands) for chips, and assembly partners like Inventec and Hon Hai/Foxconn (Taiwan), which add relatively low value.
As the curve rises again toward the right, value creation increases through **marketing and customer-facing activities**, again dominated by Apple (US). This includes marketing, brand management, and after-sales services, supported by partners such as TBWA/Chiat/Day for advertising. The figure highlights how the highest value is captured at both ends of the value chain—R&D and marketing—while manufacturing and assembly in the middle create comparatively less value.
