# Slide 45 of Lecture 14 contains information about Logistics Planning & Design -Transportation 06.03.2024 Slide 45

This diagram visualizes how the three major global carriers—**Maersk**, **MSC**, and **CMA CGM**—have expanded far beyond their traditional maritime “core” by pursuing acquisitions at varying distances from their original business. The concentric circles represent the degree of adjacency: the center contains core maritime and terminal activities, while the surrounding rings show **close**, **midrange**, and **distant** diversification moves.
Each company’s recent acquisitions are plotted according to how far the new activities are from their historic competencies. Close adjacencies include terminal operators, inland logistics providers, or rail companies. Midrange moves involve freight forwarding, customs services, or contract logistics. The most distant adjacencies—such as **e-commerce logistics**, **air-cargo operations**, last-mile delivery, and digital supply chain platforms—illustrate how carriers are transforming into end-to-end logistics integrators.
Maersk’s expansion (blue) highlights strong moves into **air freight**, **e-commerce logistics**, and **digital supply chain services**. MSC (orange) has focused on **rail**, **terminals**, **logistics**, and even passenger aviation (ITA Airways). CMA CGM (red) has pursued a mix of **e-commerce**, **last-mile logistics**, and **air cargo**, positioning itself similarly as a door-to-door player.
The figure links directly to the lecture’s themes on **vertical integration**, **strategic scope across the supply chain**, and **industry consolidation**. It visually shows how these firms seek to capture more value, exert greater control over the supply chain, and move from pure ocean carriers toward fully integrated logistics ecosystems.
