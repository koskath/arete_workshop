# Slide 24 of Lecture 14 contains information about Key learning points: Session 8 Distribution Systems and Service Supply Chain
Content and literature for this session focus on distribution systems and service supply chains. On the **content** side, topics include distribution channels, online versus brick‑and‑mortar selling, multi‑ and omni‑channel approaches, service supply chains, servitization and service‑dominant logic, and reverse logistics systems, illustrated, for example, by an Amazon case study. The **literature** base consists of Rigby, D. (2011), “The Future of Shopping” (*Harvard Business Review*, Vol. 89, No. 12, pp. 64–75), and Verhoef, P. C., Noordhoff, C. S. and Sloot, L. (2023), “Reflections and predictions on effects of COVID‑19 pandemic on retailing” (*Journal of Service Management*, Vol. 34, No. 2, pp. 274–293), which together highlight how retail and distribution are evolving. The **main issues** include current challenges for retailers in dealing with growing online sales, the idea of products as services, and the basics and terminology of reverse logistics. These points lead to several broad questions that address the core concerns of the session: **What is the difference between multi‑ and omni‑channel retailing? What is servitization? What is the difference between a manufacturing and a service supply chain?** All of these aspects are synthesised in Final Wrap Up 21.03.2025 Slide 24.
