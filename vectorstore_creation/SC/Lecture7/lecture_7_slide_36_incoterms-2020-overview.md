# Slide 36 of Lecture 7 contains information about Incoterms ® 2020 Overview
The image is a detailed table comparing different Incoterms. It consists of 15 columns and 11 rows, including headers.
The chart uses color coding to help distinguish responsibility zones:
- **Green rows** correspond to Incoterms usable for *any mode of transport*.  
- **Blue rows** correspond to Incoterms used *only for maritime or inland waterway transport*.

**Columns from left to right:**
1. **Incoterm** - Lists abbreviations such as EXW, FCA, FAS, FOB, CFR, CIF, CPT, CIP, DAP, DPU, and DDP.
2. **In Full Words** - Provides full forms in order: Ex Works, Free Carrier, Free Alongside Ship, Free On Board, Cost and Freight, Cost Insurance and Freight, Carriage Paid To, Carriage and Insurance Paid To, Delivered at Place, Delivered at Place Unloaded, Delivered Duty Paid.
3. **Place of Delivery (A2/B2, A1)** - Contains specific terms for each Incoterm like "Seller's Premises" and "Named Place of Delivery," with some variations.
4. **Transfer of Risks (A3/B3)** - Specifies when the transfer occurs, such as "Place of Delivery" or "Delivered on Board."
5. **Transfer of Costs (A2/B2/B9)** - Aligns with the transfer of risks but specified distinctly.
6. **Packaging, Checking and Marking (A8/B8)** - Lists either Seller or Buyer responsibilities.
7. **Inspection of Cargo (B8)** - Mostly Buyer, with some Seller responsibility for specific terms.
8. **Export Clearance (A2, A7/B7)** - Primarily Seller responsibility.
9. **Loading of Cargo (A4, A2/B2)** - Varies between Buyer and Seller.
10. **Cost of Pre-carriage (A2, A3/B3)** - Responsibilities vary by Incoterm.
11. **Handling at Port/Point of Departure (A4, A9/B9)** - Different responsibilities for Buyer and Seller.
12. **Main Transport (A2, A4/B4)** - Primarily Seller responsibility, highlighted in various cells.
13. **Cargo Insurance (A5/B5)** - Noted as Seller's responsibility for CIF and CIP with specific insurance requirements.
14. **Handling at Port/Point of Destination (A4, A9/B9)** - Either Buyer or under specific conditions.
15. **Cost of Onward Carriage (A2, A3/A3)** - Costs split among parties.
16. **Transit Clearance (A2, A7/B7)** - Mostly Seller responsibilities.
17. **Import Clearance (A2, A7/B7)** - Predominantly Buyer responsibility.
18. **Unloading of Cargo (A4, A2/B2)** - Primarily Buyer, with Seller under specific terms.

## How to Interpret the Table
Each cell in the table shows either **Seller** or **Buyer**, indicating who is responsible for that stage of the shipment under the corresponding Incoterm. Some cells include footnotes (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) clarifying special cases, such as:
- Pre-shipment inspection costs
- Who loads/unloads in special cases
- Required cargo insurance under CIF and CIP
- Contract-dependent responsibilities.
For example:
- Under **EXW**, the seller has minimal obligations—mostly packaging—while the buyer covers virtually everything else.  
- Under **FOB**, the seller handles export clearance and loading on board; risks transfer once the goods are on the ship.  
- Under **CIF**, the seller must arrange and pay for main transport and insurance.  
- Under **DDP**, the seller handles nearly all tasks, including import clearance.

## Visual Logic of the Chart
The matrix effectively illustrates the **progressive shift in responsibility**:
- From seller-light terms (EXW) at the top  
- To buyer-light terms (DDP) at the bottom
The shading gives a quick visual cue about whether the contract places the logistical and financial burden primarily on the seller or the buyer.

## Purpose of the Chart
This chart is designed as a quick reference tool for traders, logistics professionals, and students to understand the distribution of responsibilities under Incoterms® 2020. It emphasizes how each term defines:
- Who pays which costs  
- Who organizes which parts of transport  
- When risk transfers from seller to buyer
