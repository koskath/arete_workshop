# Slide 23 of Lecture 7 contains information about Inward and Outward Processing

This slide explains two complementary customs procedures within the EU: **Outward Processing** and **Inward Processing**. Both procedures relate to how goods can be processed either outside or inside the EU while benefiting from reduced or suspended customs duties. The slide includes two diagrams that visually trace the movement of goods through each process.
Outward Processing refers to a situation in which **Union goods are temporarily exported from the EU to be processed abroad**. The goal is to allow goods to undergo manufacturing, repair, or alteration in a non-EU country and then return to the EU with significantly reduced customs duties. When these goods re-enter the EU, import duties are not charged on the entire value of the goods; instead, duties apply only to the **value added abroad**. This means that the processing cost outside the EU becomes the basis for calculating customs duties, making it an economically attractive option for EU companies seeking specialized or cost-efficient processing abroad.
### Description of the Diagram (Top Image)
The diagram begins with a product marked with the EU flag, symbolizing its status as a Union good. The first step is **Outward Processing**, where the goods leave the EU customs territory and enter a phase labelled “Temporary Exportation.” From here, the goods are sent to a third, non-EU country, shown with a Chinese flag and a gear icon to indicate processing. Once processing is complete, the goods are sent back to the EU under **Re-Importation**. Upon return, they can be **released into free circulation**, at which point duties are calculated only on the value added during the non-EU processing stage.

Inward Processing works in the opposite direction. It allows goods from non-EU countries to enter the EU **without paying duties or taxes at import**, provided they will undergo processing inside the EU. This suspension arrangement is designed to encourage manufacturing and value-adding activities within EU territory. After processing, the goods may either be **re-exported** to a non-EU country or **released into free circulation** within the EU. If released into free circulation, duties are assessed based on the processed goods, often resulting in a more favorable tariff treatment.
### Description of the Diagram (Bottom Image)
The second diagram begins with goods arriving from a non-EU country, represented by the Chinese flag. These goods enter the procedure under **Inward Processing**, where duty payment is suspended. They are then processed inside the EU, indicated by the gear symbol. After processing, two outcomes are possible. The goods may be **re-exported** back to a non-EU market, keeping them outside the EU economy entirely. Alternatively, they can be **released into free circulation** within the EU, shown by the EU flag and euro symbols. In that case, customs duties are paid at this stage, but they are calculated on the resulting processed product, which may reduce costs if processing results in a lower tariff classification.

## Overall Purpose
Both outward and inward processing procedures allow companies to optimize supply chains and reduce customs burdens. Outward processing helps EU firms outsource manufacturing steps abroad at competitive costs, while inward processing allows non-EU materials to be transformed within the EU before duties are charged. Together, these procedures support international production workflows and enhance the economic flexibility of EU businesses.
