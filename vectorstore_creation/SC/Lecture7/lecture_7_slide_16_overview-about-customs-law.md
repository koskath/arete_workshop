# Slide 16 of Lecture 7 contains information about Overview about Customs Law

The image presents a structured overview of how **customs law** is organized across three levels:  
**Multinational Conventions**, **EU Customs Law**, and **National Customs Law**.  
Each level is illustrated using scroll-like blocks with arrows showing how the legal framework flows from international agreements to EU-level regulations and finally to national legislation.

## 1. Multinational Conventions (Left Column)

This column lists international agreements that form the foundation for global customs standards. Examples shown include:

- **(Revised) Kyoto Convention (1999)**  
  International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures.

- **ATA Convention (1963)**  
  Regulates the temporary admission of goods.

- **TIR Convention (1975)**  
  Facilitates international transit of goods.

- **…** (More conventions implied)

These conventions influence and harmonize customs processes across countries.


## 2. EU Customs Law (Middle Column)

This column explains the evolution of EU-level customs legislation.

### Older Framework (Crossed Out)
The following regulations are shown **crossed out**, indicating they have been replaced:

- **Community Customs Code (CCC)**  
  Reg. (EEC) No. 2913/92 ff.
  
- **Implementing Provisions (IP)**  
  Reg. (EEC) No. 2454/93 ff.

- **Modernized Customs Code (MCC)**  
  Reg. (EC) No. 450/2008  
  (Never fully entered into force)

### Current Framework
The bottom scroll represents the **current operative EU customs law**:

- **Union Customs Code (UCC)**  
  Reg. (EU) No. 952/2013

- **Union Customs Code Implementing Acts (IA) & Delegated Acts (DA)**  
  Clarify how the UCC should be applied in practice.

## 3. National Customs Law (Right Column)

National customs law implements EU customs law into each Member State’s legal system.

The example shown:

- **Toldloven (Customs Act)** – Danish Customs Act  
  Order No. 28 of 11/01/2018  
  With a link to Danish legal resources:
  https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/2018/28

Each EU Member State has its own customs legislation aligned with the UCC.


## Notes (Bottom Right)

- **Implementing Acts:**  
  The European Commission creates legally binding acts to ensure uniform application of EU regulations. Member States supervise the Commission’s powers.

- **Delegated Acts:**  
  The Commission creates non-legislative acts to supplement or amend EU laws (Directives or Regulations).


# Overall Purpose

The diagram shows how customs law is structured:
- **International conventions** set global standards.  
- The **EU Customs Code (UCC)** harmonizes customs rules across EU Member States.  
- Individual countries implement these rules through their **national customs legislation**.

This visual highlights both the hierarchy and evolution of customs law in Europe.
