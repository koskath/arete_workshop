# Slide 19 of Lecture 7 contains information about Customs Declaration and Procedures (since 01/05/2016)

The image is a flowchart illustrating the different types of **customs-approved treatments or uses** available under EU customs law (post–01/05/2016). It shows how goods may be handled when entering or leaving customs territory, including standard and special procedures.


## Top Level: Customs-Approved Treatment or Use

At the top of the chart is a single box labeled:

- **Customs-approved treatment or use**

This represents the overall category of actions that goods may undergo when managed by customs authorities.


## Main Branches Under Customs-Approved Treatment

From this top category, four options are shown:

1. **Customs Procedure**  
2. **Abandonment to the Exchequer**  
3. **Destruction of Goods**  
4. **(Under Customs Procedure →) Export Procedure (+ Re-exportation)**


## Customs Procedure (Central Path)

Selecting **Customs Procedure** leads to three possible directions:

- **Release into free circulation**  
- **Special Procedures**  
- **Export Procedure (+ Re-exportation)**  


## Special Procedures (Core Category)

The **Special Procedures** box expands into four major groups:

### 1. Storage
Includes:
- **Customs warehousing**  
- **Entry to a free zone**

### 2. Specific Use
Includes:
- **Temporary Admission**  
- **End Use**  
  (formerly “release into free circulation under surveillance”)

### 3. Processing
Includes:
- **Inward Processing**  
  (with a note: *including processing under customs control*)  
- **Outward Processing**

### 4. Transit
Includes:
- **Transit Procedures**


# Overall Purpose of the Diagram

The image provides a structured overview of all major customs procedures available under the Union Customs Code (UCC) since 2016. It distinguishes between basic customs actions (such as release or export) and **special procedures** (storage, specific use, processing, and transit), clarifying the pathways available for the legal handling of goods under customs supervision.
