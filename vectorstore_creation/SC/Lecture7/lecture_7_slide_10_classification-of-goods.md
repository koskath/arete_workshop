# Slide 10 of Lecture 7 contains information about Classification of Goods

Classification of Goods are usually done according to Harmonized System (HS)
which is included and extended by the Combined Nomenclature (CN). HS Nomenclature includes about 5,000 commodity groups which are identified by a 6-digit code and arranged according to a legal and logical structure based on fixed rules and is supported by well-defined rules to achieve uniform classification. The system is used by more than 200 countries and economies as a basis for their Customs tariffs and for the collection of international trade statistics. Over 98 % of the merchandise in international trade is classified in terms of the HS. For more details see: http://www wcoomd.org/en/topics/nomenclature.aspx The Combined Nomenclature of the European Union (EU) integrates HS and includes additional 4 to 5-digit subdivisions and legal notes specifically created to address the needs of the EU.
