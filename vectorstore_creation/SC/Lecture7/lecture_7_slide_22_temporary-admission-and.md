# Slide 22 of Lecture 7 contains information about Temporary Admission and Processing under Customs Control
The slide explains two different **special customs procedures** within the EU:  
**(1) Temporary Admission** and **(2) Processing under Customs Control**.  
Both involve postponing or avoiding import duties under specific conditions. The slide contains two diagrams that visually illustrate the flow of goods through each procedure.

## 1. Temporary Admission
### Text Explanation
Temporary Admission allows goods to be **used or displayed in the EU without paying import duties or taxes**, provided:
- They are imported only temporarily.
- They are **re-exported in the same state** (no substantial transformation).
- Release into free circulation is *not* intended or normally permitted under this procedure.

This procedure is commonly used for:
- Exhibition goods  
- Professional equipment  
- Goods temporarily brought in for testing or demonstration  

### Picture Description (Top Diagram)
The top diagram shows the process using symbols and flags:

1. **Importation**:  
   A good arrives from a non-EU country (shown with a Swiss flag).
2. **Temporary Admission**:  
   A box labeled “Temporary Admission” with a prohibition symbol over customs duties—meaning **no duties are paid**.
3. **Use in the EU**:  
   Goods are used or displayed inside the EU.
4. **Re-exportation**:  
   Goods leave the EU and return to the original non-EU country (Swiss flag).
5. **Prohibited release**:  
   A crossed-out EU flag and a crossed-out “Release into Free Circulation” symbol indicate that the goods **cannot** be converted into Union goods under this procedure.

The diagram emphasizes:  
**Temporary Admission = Use in EU → Re-export → No duties → No free circulation.**

## 2. Processing under Customs Control
### Text Explanation
Processing under Customs Control allows goods to undergo **processing or treatment in the EU** with:
- Postponement of duties and taxes.
- Assessment of lower duties after processing, **if the processing results in lower-value goods**  
  (example: denaturing alcohol).
This procedure enables businesses to import goods, modify them under customs supervision, and then:
- Re-export them, or  
- Release them into free circulation at a reduced duty rate based on their **processed condition**.

### Picture Description (Bottom Diagram)
1. **Importation**:  
   A product arrives from a non-EU country (example shown with a Ukrainian flag).
2. **Processing under Customs Control**:  
   A box labelled “Processing under Customs Control,” again with a symbol showing suspended duty payment.
3. **Processing in the EU**:  
   Goods undergo manufacturing, alteration, or degradation (represented by gear icons).
4. **Release into Free Circulation**:  
   A final EU flag and a symbol showing euro coins indicate that the processed goods may be **released into free circulation**, with duties calculated based on their processed form.
The diagram highlights:  
**Processing → Value modification → Free circulation allowed (with adjusted duties).**

# Overall Purpose of the Slide

The slide compares two customs regimes:
- **Temporary Admission**  
  → Goods enter the EU temporarily, no duties, must be re-exported unchanged.
- **Processing under Customs Control**  
  → Goods can be processed in the EU, and duties are assessed afterward, often at a reduced rate.
Both offer significant customs benefits but differ in their intended use and the treatment of goods.
