# The image 2 in slide 3 of lecture 7 contains:
The image shows a flowchart with two rows of chevron-shaped blocks, organized into a hierarchical structure. 

In the top row, there are three large chevrons pointing to the right. They are labeled, from left to right, as follows:
1. "BUY"
2. "SHIP"
3. "PAY"

Beneath the top row, there is a second row composed of five smaller chevrons, also pointing to the right, extending from the lower edge of the "SHIP" chevron. These are labeled, from left to right, as follows:
1. "Prepare for export"
2. "Export"
3. "Transport"
4. "Prepare For Import"
5. "Import"

The chevrons in the lower row are aligned horizontally and connect with the lower edge of the "SHIP" chevron in the top row. The structure visually represents a sequence of actions in a logical flow.
