# Slide 5 of Lecture 7 contains information about Economic Integration Levels 1/2
The image is a world map illustrating various levels of economic integration across different regions through color coding. Here's a connection to supply chain analytics:

1. **Multilateral Free Trade Agreement (Orange)**: Regions like NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) are highlighted. In supply chain analytics, these agreements reduce tariffs, allowing for smoother cross-border supply chains and reducing lead times. Analytics can optimize routes and inventory management by leveraging tariff reductions.

2. **Common Market (Light Blue)**: This level allows not only free trade of goods but also free movement of labor and capital within the market. Supply chain analytics in common markets can exploit labor mobility to optimize workforce deployment and enhance cost efficiency.

3. **Customs Union (Red)**: MERCOSUR (Southern Common Market) is an example, where members agree on common external tariffs. In supply chain analytics, understanding tariff structures helps in planning imports and exports appropriately to minimize costs.

4. **Economic Union (Yellow)**: These include countries that combine customs union with additional common policies. Analytics in these regions can focus on compliance with shared regulations and streamline operations by standardizing procedures across the union.

5. **Economic & Monetary Union (Green)**: The EU (European Union) is marked here, where countries not only share a market but also a currency. Supply chain analytics can optimize currency risk management and harmonize pricing strategies across the member countries.

Each level of integration affects supply chain strategies differently, necessitating tailored analytics to optimize performance and compliance within each framework.
