# Slide 21 of Lecture 7 contains information about Customs Warehousing and Entry in a Free Zone

Customs warehousing allows the **postponement of duties and taxes** on goods imported from countries outside the EU.
### Key Points
- Duties and taxes are assessed **only when goods are released into free circulation** or when they are **re-exported**.
- **Union goods** may also be placed in a customs warehouse to:
  - Support export refund processes  
  - Allow repayment of import duties  

### Diagram Explanation (Top Right)

The diagram shows a simplified movement of goods:
1. Goods imported from a **non-EU country** (represented by the U.S. flag).  
2. Goods enter **Customs Warehousing**.  
3. Goods can either:
   - Move to a **public or private warehouse**, then be **re-exported**, returning to the U.S.  
   - Or proceed to **release into free circulation**, becoming **Union goods** (EU flag).
This visual highlights the flexibility of warehousing—goods may be circulated, stored, or re-exported without immediately paying duties.

## Entry into a Free Zone
A **Free Zone** is a designated area inside the EU customs territory where: goods placed inside are free of duties and taxes, they remain under customs supervision but enjoy special regulatory treatment.

### Key Points
- **Control Type I** free zones have a perimeter fence, and goods placed inside automatically fall under the free-zone regime.
- **Control Type II** free zones follow rules similar to those used in customs warehousing.
- Free zones simplify movement, storage, processing, and re-export of goods.

# Overall Purpose

The image clarifies how the EU uses customs warehouses and free zones to facilitate international trade.  
Both systems allow businesses to delay or avoid customs duties, enhance logistic operations, and support re-export strategies within the EU.
