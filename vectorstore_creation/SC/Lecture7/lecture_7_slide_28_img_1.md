The picture at the bottom of the slide is a screenshot of the **Danish Customs Tariff portal** hosted on *skat.dk*, the official website of the Danish Tax and Customs Administration. It shows the online interface where users can access tariff information, import/export rules, and calculation tools.
The interface is dominated by a **dark blue header bar** with the *skat.dk* logo on the right side. Below this header is a horizontal navigation menu with three main tabs: **Home**, **TARIC**, and **About**. Beneath these, a second menu row offers specific tools and categories such as **Nomenclature**, **Measures**, **Calc of duties**, **Quotas**, **Reports**, and **More info**, indicating the various functionalities available to users looking up customs-related data.
The screenshot also includes a small section at the bottom displaying the contact number of the Danish Customs Administration and a note stating that *skat.dk is the digital gateway for self-service and guidance on taxes and duties*. A small Danish flag icon appears in the corner, indicating language or regional settings.
Overall, the picture shows the official interface used by traders, customs brokers, and import/export professionals to navigate Denmark’s integrated customs tariff system, enabling searches, calculations, and retrieval of customs-related information.
