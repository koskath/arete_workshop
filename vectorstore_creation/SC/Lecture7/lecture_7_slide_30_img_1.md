# The image 1 in slide 30 of lecture 7 contains:
The chart on the right side of the slide visually maps the **network of preferential trade relationships** connected to the EU27 (and the UK, as historically included in these frameworks). It illustrates how rules of origin operate across different regions and agreements, focusing on **contractual preferences**, **autonomous preferences**, and **cumulation zones**.
At the center of the diagram is a large circle labeled **EU27 (& UK)**. From this central point, numerous arrows radiate outward to show the wide range of countries and regional groups with which the EU has preferential trade agreements or customs arrangements. These arrows represent the flow of **origin cumulation**, meaning that materials originating in those partner regions may count as “originating” when manufacturing goods under specific preference zones.

## Key Regional and Trade Groups in the Diagram

### **1. CEFTA (Top Left)**
A turquoise box lists CEFTA members:
- Albania  
- Bosnia and Herzegovina  
- FYROM (North Macedonia)  
- Montenegro  
- Serbia (SAP\*)  
- Kosovo (UNMIK)  
- Moldova
Arrows connect CEFTA countries toward the EU, indicating that cumulation is possible within this zone.

### **2. PAN-EURO-MED Zone (Top Right)**
The large green “PAN EURO MED” block represents a broad cumulation area including:
- EFTA, EEC, Turkey  
- Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia  
- Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine  
- Faroe Islands and Syria
This zone is one of the widest networks for diagonal cumulation, allowing cross-regional inputs to count as originating under shared preferential rules.

### **3. Customs Unions and Associated Territories**
A grey box next to the EU shows:
- Customs unions with Turkey, Monaco, San Marino  
- Some Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT)
These partners have uniquely close customs integrations with the EU.

### **4. African, Caribbean and Pacific Group (ACP)**
A circular node labeled **ACP** is linked to the EU. It reflects longstanding preferential access through historical conventions and successor frameworks.

### **5. Market Access Regulation (MAR)**
Another circular node represents developing-country preferences under MAR.

### **6. Former Generalised System of Preferences (GSP)**
Shown as an input into ACP and MAR, indicating evolution of EU unilateral trade preference schemes.

### **7. CARIFORUM / ESA / PACIFIC / CEMAC (EPA)**
At the bottom right, these regional groups appear together, representing Economic Partnership Agreements with the EU.

### **8. Other individual countries**
Arrows also point to:
- Chile, Mexico  
- Peru, Colombia  
- South Africa  
- South Korea  
- Canada  
- Japan, Singapore, Vietnam  
- Central America  
- Georgia, Ukraine  
- Andorra, Ceuta & Melilla  
- Other OCTs
Each arrow demonstrates where **contractual customs preferences** or **autonomous preferences** apply for rules of origin.

## How the Chart Supports the Slide’s Context
The slide introduces the concept of **customs preferences** (both contractual and autonomous) and highlights that **cumulation** can occur within specific zones such as CEFTA or PAN EURO MED. The chart visually demonstrates how the EU is embedded in a web of regional and bilateral agreements that allow for preferential tariff treatment when goods meet specific rules of origin.
It shows that the EU’s trade preference landscape is **highly interconnected**, enabling materials or processing from multiple partner countries to “cumulate” and qualify for preferential treatment—an essential concept for understanding how origin rules function in global value chains.
