The image illustrates the structure of a Harmonized System (HS) code, which is crucial for the classification of goods in international trade. The HS code is a standardized numerical method for classifying traded products and is used by customs authorities around the world.

1. **Chapter HS (Digits 1-2):** These digits represent the broad category or chapter of goods.
2. **Position HS (Digits 3-4):** These digits further specify the type of goods within the chapter.
3. **Subposition HS (Digits 5-6):** This is a more detailed classification within the position, giving more specific categorization of the product.
4. **Subposition CN (Digit 7):** Refers to an additional level used by the European Union, known as the Combined Nomenclature.
5. **Subposition TARIC (Digits 8-9):** These digits relate to the TARIC code, which is the integrated tariff of the EU, providing additional detail.
6. **National (Digit 10-11):** Additional national-specific codes for further classification by individual countries.

**Connection to Supply Chain Analytics:**

Understanding the HS code system is critical for supply chain analytics as it allows companies to efficiently manage and classify products for international trade. Accurate classification can:

- **Optimize Supply Chain Operations:** Help in tariff determination, reducing delays at customs by ensuring correct paperwork.
- **Enhance Cost Analysis:** Provide insights into duty costs and potential savings through free trade agreements.
- **Improve Demand Forecasting:** Enable analysis of import/export trends.
- **Ensure Compliance:** Assure that goods meet international regulations and trade agreements.
- **Facilitate Risk Management:** Identify risks associated with supply chain disruptions due to regulatory changes.

Supply chain analytics use HS codes to perform data-driven decision-making, optimize logistics, and enhance overall efficiency in international trade processes.
