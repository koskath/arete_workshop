# Slide 12 of Lecture 14 contains information about the TL Strategies.

Unsupervised transfer learning mirrors the inductive strategy but operates when both source and target domains lack labels, allowing models to develop new capabilities by discovering structure in unlabeled data. For instance, training on unlabeled vehicle images can still teach a model the similarities and differences needed to distinguish motorcycle types in traffic scenes.
