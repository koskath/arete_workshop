# Slide 15 of Lecture 14 contains information about the Privacy-Accuracy trade-off.

Federated learning faces a privacy–accuracy trade-off because every exchange of model updates with the central server improves performance yet exposes signals that attackers might exploit to infer training data or compromise the model. The more rounds of communication, the greater the risk of inference attacks, so current research emphasizes minimizing and neutralizing these threats.
