# Slide 34 of Lecture 14 contains information about the XAI.

Because there is no universal agreement on the definitions of explainability and interpretability, it helps to distinguish them clearly: explainability focuses on how the AI produced a result, while interpretability captures how well humans can anticipate or understand that output. XAI generally analyzes outcomes after they are generated, whereas responsible AI emphasizes designing accountable systems from the planning stage onward; together, these perspectives reinforce one another to produce better AI.
