# Here is what the image 2 in slide 23 of lecture 14 contains:

The image contains a diagram illustrating a process involving parallel computing and optimization. It features three stylized drawings of laptops arranged vertically, each with a screen displaying two squares connected by arrows, suggesting an internal process or data flow. The laptops are connected using black arrows, converging and diverging from a central point.

- The top laptop is annotated above with the text "parallel computing."
- The left side of the image has the text "sample inefficient learning problem," with lines connecting this text to each laptop via arrows pointing right.
- Each laptop has an arrow leading to a central point, represented by a circle, from their right side.
- Arrows from the central point diverge and point back to each laptop, creating a cyclic flow.
- To the right of the circle is an arrow pointing towards the annotation "optimal policy."

The layout creates a cyclic flow conveying iterative processing involving parallel computing to solve a learning problem, aimed at reaching an optimal policy.
