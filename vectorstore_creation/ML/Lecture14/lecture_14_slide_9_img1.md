# Here is what the image 1 in slide 9 of lecture 14 contains:

The image contains three side-by-side diagrams labeled (a), (b), and (c), each within separate rectangular plots.

**Diagram (a): Horizontal Federated Learning**
- The rectangle is divided into three main color-coded areas: 
  - A green rectangle labeled "Data from A" occupies the upper left portion.
  - An orange rectangle labeled "Data from B" occupies the lower right portion.
  - A narrower orange rectangle labeled "Labels" is on the far right.
- A horizontal dashed red line divides Data from A and Data from B labeled as Horizontally Federated Learning.
- The vertical axis on the left is labeled "Samples" in brown.
- The horizontal axis below is labeled "Features" in brown.

**Diagram (b): Vertical Federated Learning**
- The rectangle contains: 
  - A green rectangle at the top labeled "Data from A".
  - An overlapping orange rectangle at the bottom labeled "Data from B".
  - An orange rectangle on the far right labeled "Labels".
- A vertical dashed red line labeled Vertically Federated Learning divides Data from A and Data from B, running horizontally across the middle. 
- The vertical axis on the left is labeled "Samples" in brown.
- The horizontal axis below is labeled "Features" in brown.

**Diagram (c): Federated Transfer Learning**
- The rectangle includes:
  - A large green rectangle in the upper left labeled "Data from A".
  - An overlapping orange rectangle in the lower right labeled "Data from B".
  - A vertical orange rectangle on the far right labeled "Labels".
- An arrow with a checkmark, labeled "Federated Transfer Learning", extends horizontally from the top right to the far right.
- The vertical axis on the left is labeled "Samples" in brown.
- The horizontal axis below is labeled "Features" in brown.

Each diagram features the same axis labels for "Samples" (vertical) and "Features" (horizontal). The areas marked "Data from A" and "Data from B" are color-coded consistently across the diagrams, with green for A and orange for B. The labels box remains orange in all diagrams.
