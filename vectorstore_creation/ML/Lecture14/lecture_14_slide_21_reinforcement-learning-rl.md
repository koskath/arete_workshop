# Slide 21 of Lecture 14 contains information about the Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Complex reinforcement-learning problems are often tackled with deep RL, where DNNs learn to encode sophisticated behaviors—such as automated driving decisions from camera feeds or robotic pick-and-place skills and the same framework extends to text summarization, question answering, and machine translation.
