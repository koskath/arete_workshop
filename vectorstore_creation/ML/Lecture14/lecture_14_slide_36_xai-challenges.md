# Slide 36 of Lecture 14 contains information about the XAI Challenges.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 36 of lecture 14 contains:

The image is a structured diagram organized into three main columns titled "Learn a model," "Explain decisions," and "Perform a task." It is further divided into two rows labeled "Data Analytics" and "Autonomy."

### Top Row: Data Analytics
- **Left Column: Learn a model**
  - Subheading: "Classification Learning Task"
  - Content: An image labeled "Multimedia Data" depicting a satellite view of two trucks with the overlay text "Two trucks performing a loading activity."
  - Text below the image: "Classifies items of interest in large data set."

- **Middle Column: Explain decisions**
  - Text in a rectangular box: "Explainable Model" and "Explanation Interface."
  - Arrows connect this box to both the "Multimedia Data" image (input) and the next column.

- **Right Column: Perform a task**
  - Text: "Analyst decides which items to report, pursue."
  - Image of an analyst at computer screens.
  - Annotated actions: "Recommend" and "Explanation" pointing to this section.
  - Right margin text: "An analyst is searching for items of interest in massive multimedia data sets."

### Bottom Row: Autonomy
- **Left Column: Learn a model**
  - Subheading: "Sequential Learning Task"
  - Content: An image labeled "Autonomous device" showing a schematic of interconnected nodes labeled with numbers.
  - Text below the image: "Learns decision policies for missions."

- **Middle Column: Explain decisions**
  - Text in a rectangular box: "Explainable Model" and "Explanation Interface."
  - Arrows connect this box to both the "Autonomous device" image (input) and the next column.

- **Right Column: Perform a task**
  - Text: "Operator decides which future tasks to delegate."
  - Image of a drone with operators standing in a field.
  - Annotated actions: "Actions" and "Explanation" pointing to this section.
  - Right margin text: "An operator is directing autonomous systems to perform a series of missions."

The diagram segments are surrounded by gridlines for visual separation, and arrows indicate the flow of processes from learning models to performing tasks within each task type.
