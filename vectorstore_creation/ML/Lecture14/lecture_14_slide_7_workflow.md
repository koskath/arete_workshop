# Slide 7 of Lecture 14 contains information about the Workflow.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 7 of lecture 14 contains:

A diagram is divided into two primary sections labeled "development environment" and "production environment," separated by a vertical dotted line.

On the left side of the diagram, within the "development environment":

1. At the far left, there is a gray silhouette of a person.
2. To the right of the silhouette, there is an arrow looping back to the left, labeled "simulate," and pointing to a rectangular box with curved sides. This box contains the text: 
   - "Model Program"
   - "TensorFlow"
3. From this rectangular box, a thick green arrow labeled "generate" points to the right, connecting to another rectangular box labeled "FL Plan."

In the center of the diagram, bridging both environments:

1. A thick green arrow labeled "deploy" extends from the "FL Plan" box to a cloud shape on the right side. 

On the right side of the diagram, within the "production environment":

1. The cloud shape is labeled "FL Server."
2. Two arrows emerge from the right of the cloud:
   - A top arrow points toward two small screen devices and is labeled "download plan & model."
   - A bottom arrow points from the devices back to the cloud, labeled "upload model & metrics."

Below the main elements, a dashed horizontal arrow spans across both environments, labeled "analytics." It is illustrated by four icons at the bottom left showing various data representations: bar chart, pie chart, line chart, and a combined line and pie chart. 

The overall layout shows a flow from left to right, then central back and forth interaction, and a feedback loop at the bottom.
