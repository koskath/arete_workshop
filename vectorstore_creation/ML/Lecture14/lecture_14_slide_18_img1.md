# Here is what the image 1 in slide 18 of lecture 14 contains:

The image contains a Venn diagram with a light gray background. The Venn diagram features three overlapping circles, each with a distinct color, and a central overlapping region. The entire diagram is enclosed in a large, thin light gray circle. At the top of the diagram, outside the large circle, is the text "MACHINE LEARNING" in bold, uppercase purple font.

Inside the Venn diagram:

1. The left circle is light blue, labeled "SUPERVISED LEARNING" in white bold, uppercase font.
   
2. The right circle is orange, labeled "UNSUPERVISED LEARNING" in white bold, uppercase font.
   
3. The bottom circle is light green, labeled "REINFORCEMENT LEARNING" in white bold, uppercase font.

The central overlapping region of the three circles is dark purple and labeled "DEEP LEARNING" in white bold, uppercase font. Each of the circles is equal in size and positioned such that they overlap symmetrically around the central "DEEP LEARNING" area.
