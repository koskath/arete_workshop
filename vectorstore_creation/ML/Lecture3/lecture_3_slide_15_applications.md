# Slide 15 of Lecture 3 contains information about the Applications.

Applications include dimensionality reduction as a preprocessing step to lower the number of dimensions while preserving meaningful properties of the input data, outlier detection for spotting instances with low affinity to any cluster, and semi-supervised learning, where limited labels prompt clustering so labels can be propagated to all instances in the same group.
