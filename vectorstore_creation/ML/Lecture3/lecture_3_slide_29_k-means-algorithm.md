# Slide 29 of Lecture 3 contains information about the K-Means Algorithm.

The computational complexity of K-Means is generally linear in the number of instances (m), clusters (k), and dimensions (n) when the data has a clustering structure, but in worst-case scenarios without such structure the complexity can grow exponentially with the number of instances, even though K-Means remains one of the fastest clustering algorithms overall.
