# Slide 14 of Lecture 3 contains information about the No 'BEST!!'.

There are many candidate algorithms for any given problem and no overall best option, because each method has its own advantages and limitations, so the best approach is often a simple algorithm paired with lots of data; the choice frequently depends on data volume since some algorithms scale better than others and most produce better results as the volume increases.
