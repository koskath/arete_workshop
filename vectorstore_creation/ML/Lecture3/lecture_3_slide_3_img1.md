# Here is what the image 1 in slide 3 of lecture 3 contains:

The image depicts a hierarchical relationship in computer science and its subdivisions. The background is a light orange color with a solid black border surrounding the entire image.

1. **Top Section**:
   - In the top left corner, the title "Computer Science" is written in bold black text.

2. **Left Box**:
   - Located in the center-left, a light gray rounded rectangle contains several text lines:
      - "Mathematical foundations"
      - "Algorithms and data structures"
      - "Artificial Intelligence" (in bold black text)
      - "Communication and security"
      - "Computer Architecture"
      - "Databases"
      - "……" (indicating continuation)

3. **Arrow from Left Box**:
   - An orange arrow points right from "Artificial Intelligence" towards the next box.

4. **Middle Box**:
   - On the right side of the left box, another light gray rounded rectangle contains:
      - "Symbolic AI (e.g. Expert Systems)"
      - "Probabilistic AI (e.g. Search & optimization)"
      - "Machine Learning" (in bold black text)

5. **Arrow from Middle Box**:
   - An orange arrow points right from "Machine Learning" towards the next box.

6. **Right Box**:
   - To the right of the middle box, a third light gray rounded rectangle contains:
      - "Decision trees"
      - "Bayesian inference"
      - "Deep learning"
      - "Reinforced learning"
      - "Support vector machines"
      - "Neural networks"
      - "Random forest"
      - "……" (indicating continuation)

Each box and arrow creates a flow from left to right, illustrating the relationship between computer science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, leading to specific methods and techniques.
