# Here is what the graph 1 in slide 34 of lecture 3 contains:

The image contains a code snippet and a plot with accompanying text. 

### Code Snippet:
- The code at the top reads: `from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score silhouette_score(X, kmeans.labels_)`. 
- The code is written in two colors: 
  - "from sklearn.metrics import" and "silhouette_score(X, kmeans.labels_)" are in black.
  - "silhouette_score" is in blue.

### Plot:
- The plot is a 2D line graph with:
  - X-axis labeled as "k."
  - Y-axis labeled as "Silhouette score."
- X-axis values range from 2 to 8, marked at ticks for each integer value.
- Y-axis values range from 0.550 to 0.700, marked at ticks for 0.550, 0.575, 0.600, 0.625, 0.650, 0.675, and 0.700.
  
#### Data Points and Line:
- Seven data points are represented as blue circles:
  - (2, 0.600)
  - (3, 0.575)
  - (4, 0.675)
  - (5, 0.650)
  - (6, 0.625)
  - (7, 0.625)
  - (8, 0.575)
- The data points are connected by a blue line segment.

#### Annotations:
- Below the plot, there is a text: 
  - "k = 4 is very good, k = 5 is quite good much better than k = 6 or 7."

### Structure:
- The code snippet is placed above the plot.
- The annotation text is centered below the plot.
