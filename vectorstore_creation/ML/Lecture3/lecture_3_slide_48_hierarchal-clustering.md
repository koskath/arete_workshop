# Slide 48 of Lecture 3 contains information about the Hierarchal Clustering.

Subsequent merges combine E with (D, F) at distance 1.00, then that cluster with C at distance 1.41, and finally the resulting (((D, F), E), C) cluster with (A, B) at distance 2.50, yielding a final cluster containing all objects and concluding the computation.

# Here is what the graph in slide 48 of lecture 3 contains:

The image displays a bar chart with an x-axis labeled "object" and a y-axis labeled "lifetime." Both axes are marked with arrows indicating their positive directions. The x-axis has five categories labeled D, F, E, C, A, and B, in that order from left to right.

- The y-axis has tick marks at intervals of 0.5, ranging from 0.0 to 2.5, with numerical labels at 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5.

The bars for each category are outlined in green with the following details:

1. Bar under "D" reaches to 0.5 on the y-axis with the number "2" inside.
2. Bar under "F" reaches to 1.0 on the y-axis with the number "4" inside.
3. Bar under "E" reaches to 1.5 on the y-axis with the number "5" inside.
4. Bar under "C" reaches to 2.5 on the y-axis with the number "6" inside.
5. Bar under "A" reaches to 1.0 on the y-axis with the number "3" inside.
6. Bar under "B" also reaches to 0.5 on the y-axis, which fits the pattern seen in the data.

Overall, the chart has six distinct green bars, each corresponding to a category on the x-axis, and labeled with a number within each bar indicating the height on the y-axis.
