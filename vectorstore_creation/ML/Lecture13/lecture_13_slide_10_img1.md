# Here is what the table 1 in slide 10 of lecture 13 contains:

The image contains two labeled grids of numbers.

On the left side, there is a grid labeled "without zero padding." This grid consists of 6 rows and 6 columns. Each cell of the grid contains a number. The numbers in each row from top to bottom are:

1. 251, 251, 255, 233, 182, 179
2. 250, 255, 229, 120, 66, 56
3. 253, 254, 144, 47, 29, 31
4. 255, 229, 113, 65, 56, 62
5. 255, 203, 102, 106, 82, 78
6. 254, 199, 109, 154, 95, 78

On the right side, there is a grid labeled "with zero padding." This grid consists of 8 rows and 8 columns, surrounded by zeros. Each cell of the grid contains a number. The number arrangement including zeros from top to bottom is:

1. 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2. 0, 251, 251, 255, 233, 182, 179, 0
3. 0, 250, 255, 229, 120, 66, 56, 0
4. 0, 253, 254, 144, 47, 29, 31, 0
5. 0, 255, 229, 113, 65, 56, 62, 0
6. 0, 255, 203, 102, 106, 82, 78, 0
7. 0, 254, 199, 109, 154, 95, 78, 0
8. 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Both grids are outlined with thin black lines separating the cells.
