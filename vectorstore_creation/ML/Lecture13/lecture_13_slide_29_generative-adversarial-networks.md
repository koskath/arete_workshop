# Slide 29 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Generative Adversarial Networks.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) simultaneously train two models: a generator that learns to produce realistic samples and a discriminator that distinguishes between genuine training data and generator outputs, creating a minimax game in which the generator constantly tries to fool the discriminator.
