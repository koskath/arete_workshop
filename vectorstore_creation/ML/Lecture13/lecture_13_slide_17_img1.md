# Here is what the image 1 in slide 17 of lecture 13 contains:

The image depicts a visual representation of a convolutional neural network architecture. 

On the left, there are three overlapping input images of varying color shades, with a prominent orange-tinted image featuring a traditional multi-story building amidst trees. 

Moving right, a single horizontal arrow connects the input to a stack of rectangular layers labeled "Convolution." These layers are illustrated as overlapping grey rectangles.

Continuing right, there's another arrow leading to a section labeled "Pooling," represented by single, wide rectangles.

Following this, another arrow points to a more complex structure labeled "Convolution," featuring multiple stacks of overlapping grey rectangles.

Further right, an arrow leads to a section labeled "Pooling," again represented by singular, wide rectangles.

The next segment, labeled "Fully connected," shows vertical lines of small stacked rectangles or squares. These are connected by arrows and include two vertical, dashed outlines indicating additional processing steps.

Finally, a single bold arrow points rightward, concluding the sequence. Throughout the image, the layers and arrows suggest the flow of data through the neural network.
