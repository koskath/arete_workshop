# Slide 35 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Difficulties of Training GANs.

Training GANs is difficult because the generator and discriminator continually adjust strategies in pursuit of a moving equilibrium, and reaching the point where the discriminator must guess 50/50 between real and fake is not guaranteed. The generator can also suffer mode collapse, producing less diverse outputs over time, and the opposing objectives often cause parameters to oscillate or become unstable.
