# Here is what the image 1 in slide 21 of lecture 7 contains:

The image illustrates a concept related to density-based clustering in machine learning, specifically addressing the challenge of varying densities within data. It highlights how traditional density-based approaches may struggle when different clusters have varying densities. The example shows two clusters, C1 and C2, with an outlier, o2, near C2. Although o2 shares a similar density with elements of C1, it is identified as an outlier due to its relative distance compared to its neighbors.

This demonstrates a critical aspect of data handling in machine learning: outlier detection. In clustering, outliers can skew results or indicate an anomaly. Local distance-based methods are proposed as an alternative to address this issue by considering relative distances instead of absolute densities. This approach can improve the robustness of clustering algorithms and enhance the model's ability to handle diverse datasets effectively. 

In the context of deep learning, handling outliers and varying data densities is crucial for building models that generalize well. Techniques such as these are part of preprocessing steps that ensure input data quality, ultimately influencing the performance of machine learning models.
