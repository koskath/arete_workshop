# Slide 34 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Recommender Systems.

Recommender systems aim to maximize profit through recommendations by selling items and collecting ratings from users, with different recommendation scenarios including recommending items given an item (like Amazon product recommendations), recommending items given a user (like Amazon or Netflix homepages), or a combination for personalized item-based recommendations; since users typically rate only a small number of items, the user-item matrix is sparse, which leads to the challenge of predicting missing ratings.
