# Slide 15 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Box Plot: 1.5 IQR rule.

The 1.5 IQR rule is a rule of thumb for identifying outliers by establishing upper and lower boundaries or fences outside of Q1 and Q3, where anything above Q3 plus 1.5 times the IQR or below Q1 minus 1.5 times the IQR is considered an outlier.
