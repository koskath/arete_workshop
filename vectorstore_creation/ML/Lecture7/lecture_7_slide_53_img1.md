# Here is what the image 1 in slide 53 of lecture 7 contains:

The image is a diagram representing a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classification scenario. 

- There are two types of shapes: red triangles and blue squares. 
- Red triangles are labeled as "Class 2" and blue squares as "Class 1" in a key located in the upper right corner.
- In the main diagram, a green circle with a question mark inside is located slightly below and to the left of center, labeled "New example to classify."
- Surrounding this green circle are three concentric circles representing distance.
- The nearest circle has an orange label "K=1" located on its right side and two data points inside it: a red triangle below the center and a blue square to its right.
- The second circle has no label on it and includes one additional red triangle directly above the green circle.
- This red triangle is connected by an arrow labeled "Distance," and is annotated as "Training instance."
- The third and largest circle has an orange label "K=3" located by the same blue square mentioned for K=1.
- The whole diagram is enclosed in a simple rectangular border. 

No numerical values or axes are present. The data points appear scattered without a specific alignment or pattern.
