# Here is what the image 1 in slide 41 of lecture 7 contains:

The image depicts a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with the vertical y-axis labeled "Serious" at the top and "Escapist" at the bottom, and the horizontal x-axis labeled "Geared toward females" on the left and "Geared toward males" on the right. This creates four quadrants categorized by these labels.

1. **Top Left Quadrant:**
   - Contains two items:
     - A square image of a character with dark blue hair and a bow, having a small smile and closed eyes, positioned towards the upper left. Next to it, the label "The Color Purple" in red text with a blue outline.
     - A square with the face of a person with reddish-brown hair and a simple smile. Below it, the label "Sense and Sensibility" in red text with a blue border.

2. **Top Right Quadrant:**
   - Contains two items:
     - A square with the upper half of a person's face wearing green military goggles. Adjacent to it, the label "Braveheart" in red text with a blue outline.
     - A square with a character having spiky black hair and a determined expression. Below, the label "Lethal Weapon" in red text with a blue outline.

3. **Bottom Left Quadrant:**
   - Contains one item:
     - A square with a character's face having a serene expression and closed eyes, hair blowing to the side. Next to it, the label "The Princess Diaries" in red text with a blue outline.

4. **Bottom Right Quadrant:**
   - Contains two items:
     - A square with a character wearing an orange cowboy hat and a friendly expression. Below it, the label "Dumb and Dumber" in red text with a blue outline.
     - A label "Independence Day" in red text with a blue outline situated above the label "Dumb and Dumber."

5. **Center:**
   - From the intersection of the axes, there is a character labeled "Dave," depicted wearing a white lab coat and an expressionless face.
   - Below "Dave" is the label "The Lion King" in red text with a blue outline.
   - Above the intersecting point, there is the label "Amadeus" in red text with a blue outline.
   - Another face image is positioned slightly to the right of center with features including black hair and a neutral expression. Below it, the label "Ocean's 11" in red text with a blue outline. 

This quadrant system visually categorizes different films based on the seriousness and gender orientation of their appeal.
