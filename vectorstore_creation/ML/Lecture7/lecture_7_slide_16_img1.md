# Here is what the image 1 in slide 16 of lecture 7 contains:

The image is titled "Identifying outliers with the 1.5xIQR rule." Below the title, there is a Google Classroom icon. 

The main text begins by explaining that an outlier is a data point outside the overall pattern in a distribution. The following text states: “The distribution below shows the scores on a driver's test for 19 applicants. How many outliers do you see?”

Below this text is a scatter plot on a horizontal axis marked “Scores.” The horizontal axis is numbered at intervals of five, starting from 0 and ending at 30. Vertical grid lines correspond to each mark, but no vertical axis or scale is presented. 

The data points are turquoise circles placed as follows:

- At 3 on the x-axis: one point.
- At 7 on the x-axis: one point.
- At 10 on the x-axis: one point.
- At 13 on the x-axis: one point.
- At 17 on the x-axis: one point.
- Between 19 and 20 on the x-axis: one point.
- At 22 on the x-axis: one point.
- At 23 on the x-axis: five points stacked vertically.
- At 24 on the x-axis: three points stacked vertically.
- At 25 on the x-axis: four points stacked vertically.

The text continues by discussing the ambiguity of identifying outliers, suggesting there might be different counts. It mentions statisticians have various methods for defining outliers.

The final paragraph explains the 1.5xIQR rule for outliers: a data point is an outlier if it is more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) above the third quartile (Q3) or below the first quartile (Q1). It concludes by specifying the formulas: low outliers are below Q1 − 1.5·IQR, and high outliers are above Q3 + 1.5·IQR. 

The overall layout includes properly paragraph-separated text, a centered scatter plot, numerical axis labeling, and dense data representation on the plot.
