# Here is what the image 2 in slide 50 of lecture 7 contains:

The image is a table that consists of a single horizontal row with six columns. The columns contain the following headers from left to right:

1. "Dataset"
2. "#Instances"
3. "#Attributes"
4. "Class"
5. "IR"
6. "Minority Class (%)"
7. "Degree of Imbalanced"

The table has a thin horizontal line at the top and bottom, creating a border for the header row. The text in each header cell is centered. The font is a standard serif typeface, and the first letter of each header word is capitalized. No data or additional rows are present in the table, only the header is visible.
