# Slide 5 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Outlier/Anomaly Detection.

An outlier is a data object that deviates significantly from normal objects, as if it were generated by a different mechanism, and the goal is to find observations that are unusually different from others, though defining outliers precisely can be challenging; common sources include measurement errors, data entry errors, contamination of data from different sources, and rare events.
