# Here is what the image 1 in slide 39 of lecture 7 contains:

The image depicts a matrix labeled "Y" on the left side, with the matrix elements enclosed in large square brackets. Each element within the matrix is aligned in a 3x5 grid, with the matrix labeled on the left by a brace with the word "user" in blue, and on the bottom by a blue brace labeled "movie."

The matrix consists of the following elements, from top to bottom and left to right:

- Top row: "?", "4", "3", "2", "3"
- Middle row: "2", "1", "?", "5", "?"
- Bottom row: "?", "1", "?", "5", "5"

Annotations in the matrix include:

- A green horizontal brace above the third and fourth columns, connecting rows one and two, pointing right with the handwritten text "Green Lantern" and "Ryan Reynolds."
- An orange horizontal brace above the entire first column connecting rows two and three, pointing right with the handwritten text "Similar user."
- A red vertical brace enclosing the two "5" entries in the last column, pointing right with the text "Similar movie."

The matrix is styled with hand-drawn lines and annotations, using question marks ("?") to indicate missing values in the matrix. Labels are stylized in different colors to match the braces and lines they annotate.
