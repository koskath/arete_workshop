# Slide 57 of Lecture 7 contains information about the ADASYN (extension of SMOTE).

ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling) extends SMOTE by generating an arbitrary number of synthetic minority examples to shift the classifier learning bias toward the minority class, improving class balance through linear interpolation between existing minority class examples, and creating more examples near the boundary between the two classes than in the interior of the minority class.
