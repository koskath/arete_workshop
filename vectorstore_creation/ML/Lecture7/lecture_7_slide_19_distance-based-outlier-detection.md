# Slide 19 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Distance-Based Outlier Detection.

Most outlier detection approaches are based on distances, and we can skip modeling, plotting, or clustering by directly measuring distances, such as counting how many points lie within a radius epsilon or computing the distance to the kth nearest neighbor; KNN methods are particularly effective for detecting global outliers, as shown in comparisons of 19 methods across 10 datasets, while local outliers are best identified using local distance-based methods.
