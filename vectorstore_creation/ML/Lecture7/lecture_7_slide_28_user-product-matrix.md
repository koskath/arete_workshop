# Slide 28 of Lecture 7 contains information about the User-Product Matrix.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 28 of lecture 7 contains:

The image contains a diagram illustrating a "User-Product Matrix." At the top center, the title "User-Product Matrix" is written in bold black text.

In the center, a matrix labeled "X" is depicted. It consists of vertical and horizontal black brackets outlining the structure. Within these brackets, there is a horizontal green row labeled "Xi," with a green line enclosing this row and extending across. There is also a vertical green column with no label, similarly enclosed by a green line.

Various annotations in colored text surround the matrix:

1. At the top left, written in red and green text:
   - "Column x^j gives all users that bought product j^'"

2. At the bottom left, in green text:
   - "Row xi gives all items bought by user i^'"

3. At the bottom, centered and written in blue text:
   - "products"

4. To the right of the matrix, there is a bracket labeled "users" in blue.

5. To the top right, in green text, an arrow points to the number "1" inside a green box:
   - "Xij = 1 means user 'i' bought item 'j'."

6. Below, in green text, an arrow points to the number "0" inside a green box:
   - "xij = 0 means user 'i' has not buy item 'j'."

Arrows in green accompany the annotations, directing attention to specific elements of the matrix, emphasizing the relationships between users, products, and the values 0 and 1.
