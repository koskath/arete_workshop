# Slide 32 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Cost of Finding Nearest Neighbors.

With n users and d products, finding k nearest neighbors has a cost of O(nd), which becomes infeasible when n and d are in the millions, though it's faster if the user-product matrix is sparse; the closest point problem appears in k-nearest neighbor classification, k-means clustering, density-based clustering, and Amazon product recommendation systems.
