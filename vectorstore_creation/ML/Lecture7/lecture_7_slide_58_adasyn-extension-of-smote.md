# Slide 58 of Lecture 7 contains information about the ADASYN (extension of SMOTE).

ADASYN shifts the classifier decision boundary to focus more on examples that are difficult to learn, improving learning performance by adaptively generating synthetic data samples for the minority class to reduce bias introduced by imbalanced data distribution, using dynamic adjustment of weights and an adaptive learning procedure that employs a density distribution as a criterion to decide how many synthetic samples need to be generated for each minority data example.
