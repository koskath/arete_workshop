# Slide 17 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Cluster-Based Outlier Detection.

Cluster-based outlier detection works by clustering the data and then identifying points that don't belong to any cluster; with K-means clustering, outliers are points that are far from any cluster mean or are not assigned to a cluster, and you can also find clusters with very few points, while density-based clustering methods similarly identify outliers as points that don't fit into dense regions.
