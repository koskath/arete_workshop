# Slide 21 of Lecture 7 contains information about the Local Distance-Based Outlier Detection.

As with density-based clustering, local distance-based methods address the problem of differing densities, where an outlier o2 might have similar density to elements of cluster C1, so the basic idea is that outlier o2 is relatively far compared to its immediate neighbors, even if its absolute density matches other regions.
