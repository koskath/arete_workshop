# Slide 54 of Lecture 7 contains information about the SMOTE.

• SMOTE tries to avoid the risk of overfitting.
1. First, it chooses a random minority
observation x
i
2. Next, randomly selects an instance x
u
among k nearest minority class neighbours
of x .
i
3. Finally, a new random sample s is
i
generated by interpolating the two samples:
s = x + w × (x − xi), where w is a random
i i u
weight in [0, 1].
• Does not specifically enforce decision
boundary.
