# Slide 35 of Lecture 10 contains information about the TensorFlow’s Computation: Dataflow Graph.

The image illustrates TensorFlow's Computation: Dataflow Graph, a fundamental concept defining how computations are structured and executed within the framework. This graph is a directed structure where the Nodes (represented by circles or ovals) are the mathematical operations that process data, and the Edges (the arrows) represent the flow of data in the form of N-dimensional arrays, called Tensors. The graph shows a typical sequence of operations for a model's forward pass, starting with input data and learned parameters: the weights and examples tensors are first processed by a MatMul (Matrix Multiplication) node. The output of the multiplication is then fed into an Add node, where it is combined with the biases tensor. The result then passes through a Relu (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function. Finally, the output of the activation function, along with the labels tensor, is input into the Xent (Cross-Entropy) node, which calculates the loss of the current prediction. This visualization emphasizes TensorFlow's design principle of defining the entire model structure as a static dataflow graph, allowing for efficient optimization and execution across distributed computing resources.
