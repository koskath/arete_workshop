# Here is what the image 1 in slide 10 of lecture 10 contains:

The image illustrates a neural network diagram featuring a recurrent structure. 

1. **Background**: The primary structure is enclosed within a large blue rectangle bordered by a black outline. 

2. **Components Inside**:
   - **Bottom Layer**: Contains six beige squares aligned horizontally. Each square has a "Σ" symbol at the bottom, with a square root symbol above it. 
   - **Top Component**: A larger beige rectangle displays a similar configuration but is vertically elongated. It includes another "Σ" symbol at the bottom and a square root symbol at the top.

3. **Connections**:
   - Each of the squares in the bottom layer is connected to the top rectangle by individual black arrows.
   - The squares also have connections represented by red arrows, two leading upwards from below to the bottom squares, and others crossing among them.
   - A black arrow labeled "Input," directed upwards, connects from the base to the bottom layer, labeled as "x_t."

4. **Output**:
   - An upward pointing black arrow labeled "Output" originates from the top rectangle and terminates above with the label "y_t."
   
5. **Additional Labels**:
   - Below the main blue enclosure, the label "Output from previous recurrent layer" is situated to the right with a black arrow pointing horizontally to the left, labeled as "y_{t-1}."
   - To the right of the top rectangle is a label: "Fully connected layer with Softmax activation." The word "Softmax" is highlighted in red.

This structure visually represents a neural network with an emphasis on input processing, connections, and output generation.
