# Slide 12 of Lecture 10 contains information about the RNN for Sequence Problems.

A sequence of inputs can be mapped to a single output by passing a sequence of words into the network and predicting a class such as positive or negative sentiment, which characterizes the sentiment-analysis case.

Conversely, a single input can be mapped to a sequence of outputs when, for example, an image passes through the network and the output becomes a sequence of descriptive words, which is the image-captioning problem highlighted on Slide 12.
