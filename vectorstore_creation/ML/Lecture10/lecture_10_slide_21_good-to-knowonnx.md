# Slide 21 of Lecture 10 contains information about the Good to know....ONNX.

ONNX, the Open Neural Network eXchange format (https://onnx.ai/), is an open-source shared model representation designed for framework interoperability and shared optimization.

It defines a common set of operators, data types, and file formats so developers can move models among different frameworks, tools, runtimes, and compilers, and it even specifies an extensible computation-graph model that frameworks such as TensorFlow support.
