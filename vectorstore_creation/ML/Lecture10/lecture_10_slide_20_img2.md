# Here is what the image 2 in slide 20 of lecture 10 contains:

The image presents a diagram enclosed in an orange-bordered rounded rectangle. The title "Define-by-Run" is prominently placed at the top left corner within this border.

1. **Model Definition**: A rectangle labeled "Model definition" connects to the "Computational graph" with an arrow pointing towards it.

2. **Training Data**: A cylinder labeled "Training data" is connected to the "Computational graph" via an arrow pointing from the cylinder to the graph.

3. **Computational Graph**: A central rectangle labeled "Computational graph" has multiple connections:
   - An arrow from "Model definition" points to it.
   - An arrow from "Training data" points to it.
   - An arrow labeled "Parameters" originates from the top of this box pointing towards it.
   - An arrow labeled "Dynamic change" originates from a rectangle labeled "Conditions" below it, pointing upwards.
   - An arrow extends to the right, pointing to a rectangle labeled "Gradient function."
   - Another arrow loops back to the arrow labeled "Parameters."

4. **Conditions**: A rectangle at the bottom labeled "Conditions" has an arrow labeled "Dynamic change" pointing upwards to the "Computational graph."

5. **Gradient Function**: On the right side, a rectangle labeled "Gradient function" has an inbound arrow from the "Computational graph." An arrow labeled "Update" moves in a loop back to the arrow labeled "Parameters."

All elements and labels are contained within an orange outlined boundary, suggesting a connected framework. The arrows indicate the flow of process or influence from one part of the diagram to another.
