# Here is what the image 1 in slide 27 of lecture 10 contains:

The image is a comparison table with three columns and multiple rows. Each column is headed by the name of a different framework: "TensorFlow," "PyTorch," and "Keras."

1. **Header Row:**
   - Cell 1: "TensorFlow"
   - Cell 2: "PyTorch"
   - Cell 3: "Keras"

2. **Row 1 (API Level):**
   - TensorFlow: "Both (High and Low)"
   - PyTorch: "Low"
   - Keras: "High"

3. **Row 2 (Architecture):**
   - TensorFlow: "Not easy to use"
   - PyTorch: "Complex, less readable"
   - Keras: "Simple, concise, readable"

4. **Row 3 (Datasets):**
   - TensorFlow: "Large datasets, high-performance"
   - PyTorch: "Large datasets, high-performance"
   - Keras: "Smaller datasets"

5. **Row 4 (Debugging):**
   - TensorFlow: "Difficult to conduct debugging"
   - PyTorch: "Good debugging capabilities"
   - Keras: "Simple network, so debugging is not often needed"

6. **Row 5 (Pretrained Models?):**
   - TensorFlow: "Yes"
   - PyTorch: "Yes"
   - Keras: "Yes"

7. **Row 6 (Popularity):**
   - TensorFlow: "Second most popular of the three"
   - PyTorch: "Third most popular of the three"
   - Keras: "Most popular of the three"

8. **Row 7 (Speed):**
   - TensorFlow: "Fast, high-performance"
   - PyTorch: "Fast, high-performance"
   - Keras: "Slow, low performance"

9. **Row 8 (Written In):**
   - TensorFlow: "C++, CUDA, Python"
   - PyTorch: "Lua"
   - Keras: "Python"

The table uses alternating background colors for rows, with the header row having a light beige color. There are no visible outlines or borders separating the cells or columns within the table. Each description in the table focuses on a specific feature of the frameworks.
