# Here is what the image 1 in slide 4 of lecture 8 contains:

The image consists of three separate panels arranged horizontally, depicting silhouettes of cyclists on different terrains. 

1. **Left Panel:**
   - A cyclist silhouette is positioned on a downward-sloping blue triangle.
   - The silhouette is slightly bent forward, with the rear wheel elevated above the slope.
   - Three horizontal lines behind the rear wheel suggest motion down the slope.
   - The blue triangle features a white minus sign ("-") near the bottom left.

2. **Middle Panel:**
   - A cyclist silhouette is situated on a flat, rectangular blue platform.
   - The cyclist is upright on a bicycle, wheels aligned horizontally on the platform.
   - A large white numeral “0” is centered on the blue platform below the cyclist.

3. **Right Panel:**
   - A cyclist silhouette is on an upward-sloping blue triangle.
   - The cyclist is leaning forward, climbing against the incline.
   - The blue triangle includes a white plus sign ("+") near the bottom right.

Below the panels, the text “Gradient presents slope” and “Descent: Moving down” is centered and written in black, providing context about the depicted scenarios. The overall background of the image is white.
