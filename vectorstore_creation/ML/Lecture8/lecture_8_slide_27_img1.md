# Here is what the image 1 in slide 27 of lecture 8 contains:

The image displays the Quadratic Formula, which is used to find the solutions for a general quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. In the context of L1/Lasso Regularization in a machine learning or optimization class, this formula is highly likely included to highlight the contrast between simple analytical methods and the complex numerical methods required for L1 optimization. The standard Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) solution for linear regression can be found directly using matrix algebra, which is a closed-form, analytical solution, much like the quadratic formula provides for a quadratic equation. However, the introduction of the L1 penalty term in Lasso Regression results in an objective function that is non-differentiable at zero due to the absolute value function. Consequently, the optimal solution cannot be found by simply setting the gradient to zero. Instead, the solution must be found using iterative numerical optimization methods (such as coordinate descent or proximal gradient descent). The display of the simple quadratic formula, which does provide a closed-form solution, serves to explain why iterative numerical methods, rather than simple analytical methods, are necessary for L1/Lasso regularization
