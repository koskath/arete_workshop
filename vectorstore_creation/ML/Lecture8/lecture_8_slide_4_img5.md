# Here is what the image 5 in slide 4 of lecture 8 contains:

The image shows a coordinate grid with a plotted line segment and annotations indicating changes in values. The grid is composed of vertical and horizontal lines creating squares. 

- Axes:
  - The x-axis is labeled "X" in blue at the bottom right corner and features an arrow pointing right, indicating the positive direction.
  - The y-axis is labeled "Y" in blue at the top left corner and features an arrow pointing upward.

- Line Segment:
  - A diagonal green line segment is drawn across the grid, extending from the point (1,1) to (5,4). 

- Changes:
  - A blue curly brace and the text "Change in Y" in blue are placed to the right of the green line segment. The brace extends vertically from the y-coordinate 1 to 4.
  - A red dashed horizontal line extends from (1,1) to (5,1). 
  - A red curly brace labeled "Change in X" in red spans between x-coordinates 1 to 5, lying below the red dashed line.

- Grid:
  - The grid consists of equally spaced vertical and horizontal lines, dividing the space into squares.
  
All labels and annotations are positioned to clearly denote their respective dimensions or shifts.
