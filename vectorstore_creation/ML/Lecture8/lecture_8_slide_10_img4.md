# Here is what the image 4 in slide 10 of lecture 8 contains:

The image is titled "Gradient Descent in 2D" and illustrates a contour plot with elliptical lines centered around a red point labeled "Minimizer." There are five elliptical contour lines drawn concentrically, each one progressively smaller and centered around the red point. 

The axes are labeled: the horizontal axis is labeled \( w_1 \) and the vertical axis is labeled \( w_2 \).

A series of five blue points connected by blue lines depict the path of gradient descent. The starting point, a large blue dot on the outermost contour, is labeled "Starting 'guess' \( w^0 \)." From this point, the path moves in a zigzag pattern inward:

1. The first point after the starting guess is labeled \( w^1 \), connected by a blue line and an arrow indicating direction.
2. The second point is labeled \( w^2 \) with a similar arrow.
3. The third point is labeled \( w^3 \).
4. The fourth point is labeled \( w^4 \).
5. The fifth point is labeled \( w^5 \).

Each point illustrates a step of descent, following arrows that indicate movement between successive points toward the red point labeled "Minimizer."

The overall setup showcases a typical gradient descent path depicted through blue lines and arrows, representing the iterative optimization process on the contour plot, targeting the minimization point at the center.
