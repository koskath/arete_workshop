# Here is what the image 3 in slide 10 of lecture 8 contains:

"Stop if not making progress or" is written in black text on the upper left. To the right, there's the inequality equation:

‖∇f(w^t)‖ ≤ ε

Below this inequality, there are two curved braces. The first brace is labeled "Approximate local minimum" under the expression ‖∇f(w^t)‖. The second brace connects to the ε symbol and is labeled "Some small scalar."

The text and symbols are in black on a plain white background.
