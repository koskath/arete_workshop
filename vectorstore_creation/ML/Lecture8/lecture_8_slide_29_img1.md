# Here is what the image 1 in slide 29 of lecture 8 contains:

The image is a graph illustrating the relationship between model complexity, measured by Epochs on the horizontal axis, and the Loss on the vertical axis, a critical concept in machine learning model training. The graph features two distinct loss curves: a blue 'training' curve that continuously decreases as training epochs increase, and an orange 'validation' curve that initially decreases, reaches a minimum, and then starts to increase. The entire learning process is conceptually divided into two regions by a vertical dashed line, marking the optimal stopping point labeled early stopping. The region to the left of the dashed line illustrates Underfitting, which occurs when the Model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of data. Both the training and validation loss are high in this phase, indicating insufficient training. Conversely, the region to the right of the dashed line represents Overfitting, where the training loss continues to drop, but the validation loss begins to rise. This behavior signifies that the Model performs well on training data, but it does not generalize well to new, unseen data. The practice of early stopping is implemented by halting training at the minimum point of the validation error, effectively preventing the model from entering the detrimental overfitting phase and ensuring the best balance for generalization.
