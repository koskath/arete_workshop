# Here is what the image 1 in slide 24 of lecture 8 contains:

The image features a two-dimensional plot with a set of coordinates on the X and Y axes. The X-axis is labeled "X" and extends horizontally to the right, terminating with an arrowhead pointing right. The Y-axis is labeled "Y" and extends vertically upwards, ending with an arrowhead pointing up.

In the plot, there is a blue wavy line that oscillates up and down across the graph, portraying variability with several peaks and troughs. This line appears to model the data points on the graph, following their pattern closely.

Scattered along the blue line are orange square markers. These squares represent individual data points. Some of the markers lie close to the blue line, while others are slightly above or below it.

Below the plot, centered on the X-axis, is the word "Overfitting" in black text. This suggests the plot is illustrating the concept of overfitting in a data set, where the model (represented by the blue line) tightly fits the data points, including variations.

The graph does not have a grid or numerical labels, only the axes, the plotted line, the data points, and the text annotation.
