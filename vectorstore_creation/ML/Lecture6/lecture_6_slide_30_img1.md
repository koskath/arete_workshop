# Here is what the image 1 in slide 30 of lecture 6 contains:

The image contains three side-by-side plots, each labeled with different fitting characteristics: "Underfitting," "Balanced," and "Overfitting." 

1. **Underfitting (Left Plot):**
   - The plot has two axes labeled "X" (horizontal) and "Y" (vertical) with arrows indicating positive directions.
   - There are several orange square data points scattered above and slightly below the line, suggesting a low degree of fit.
   - A straight blue line slants upwards from left to right, passing through the middle of the data point distribution without capturing much variance.
   - The bottom of the plot is labeled "Underfitting."

2. **Balanced (Middle Plot):**
   - Similar axes format as the first plot, labeled "X" and "Y."
   - Orange square data points follow a gentle curve, more closely scattered around the line compared to the first plot.
   - A smooth blue curve begins low on the left, arcs upward and dips slightly before rising again, fitting the trend of the data points.
   - The bottom of the plot is labeled "Balanced."

3. **Overfitting (Right Plot):**
   - The third plot also features axes labeled "X" and "Y."
   - Data points, marked with orange squares, appear scattered around a more complex line, with a higher variation.
   - A blue line with multiple upward and downward oscillations closely follows the positions of the data points, indicating a highly variable model.
   - The bottom of the plot is labeled "Overfitting." 

Each plot is separated visually with consistent size and structure, demonstrating different fitting models in relation to data complexity.
