# Here is what the image 1 in slide 18 of lecture 6 contains:

The image displays four scatter plots arranged in a 2x2 grid, each depicting different types of SVM kernel applications on a dataset with "Sepal width" on the y-axis and "Sepal length" on the x-axis. 

- **Top Left Plot:**
  - Title: "SVC with linear kernel"
  - Background: Divided into two regions, blue on the left and red on the right, separated by a straight diagonal boundary from the top left to the bottom right.
  - Data points: Overlapping black-outlined circles filled with white, blue, and red, clustered along the boundary line.
  - Axes: The x-axis is labeled "Sepal length" and the y-axis "Sepal width."

- **Top Right Plot:**
  - Title: "LinearSVC (linear kernel)"
  - Background: Similar color and boundary division as the top left plot, but the diagonal boundary is slightly adjusted.
  - Data points: Black-outlined circles filled with white, blue, and red, displaying a similar clustering pattern.
  - Axes: Labels identical to other plots.

- **Bottom Left Plot:**
  - Title: "SVC with RBF kernel"
  - Background: More complex boundaries with blue and red regions separated by curved sections.
  - Data points: Black-outlined circles filled with white, blue, and red, forming clusters primarily along the boundary lines.
  - Axes: Consistent labels with other plots.

- **Bottom Right Plot:**
  - Title: "SVC with polynomial (degree 3) kernel"
  - Background: Complex shaped areas with a curved boundary separating blue and red regions.
  - Data points: Black-outlined circles filled with white, blue, and red, located primarily along the separation region.
  - Axes: Same labeling as other plots.

The overall layout demonstrates how different kernel methods affect classification boundaries in SVM.
