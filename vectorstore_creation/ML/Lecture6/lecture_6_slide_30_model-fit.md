# Slide 30 of Lecture 6 contains information about the Model Fit.

To improve model accuracy you can collect more training data, engineer and process additional or better features, and tune model parameters, all while monitoring underfitting—when the model performs poorly even on training data because it fails to capture the relationship between inputs X and targets y —and overfitting, when the model performs well on training data but poorly on test data because it cannot generalize to unseen examples.
