# Slide 22 of Lecture 6 contains information about the Binary Classification.

Many binary classification algorithms output a prediction score representing the model’s confidence that an observation belongs to the positive class, and binary accuracy metrics then quantify the two kinds of correct predictions and the two kinds of errors, typically using measures such as accuracy (ACC), precision, recall, false positive rate, and F1 score.
