# Slide 12 of Lecture 6 contains information about the Classification and Regression.

In the nonlinear support vector classifier approach, a mapping is used to project data into a high-dimensional feature space where a linear regression or classification model can be applied, and kernel methods handle the dimensionality issue; notably, SVMs that receive raw pixel maps as input have achieved better accuracy than neural networks using hand-crafted features on handwriting recognition tasks.
