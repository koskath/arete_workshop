# Slide 11 of Lecture 6 contains information about the Classification and Regression.

Classification is a supervised learning approach whose goal is to produce a model that predicts target values for test instances based on their attributes, while regression can be linear or nonlinear but always requires specifying a suitable loss function—such as quadratic or Huber loss in the linear case—that includes a distance measure to penalize errors.
