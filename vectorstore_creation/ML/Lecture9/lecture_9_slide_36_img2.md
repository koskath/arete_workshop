# Here is what the image 2 in slide 36 (Bonus Slide) of lecture 9 contains:

The image contains a graph illustrating the sigmoid function. At the top left corner, there is text in bold that reads "Consider the sigmoid function:". Below the text, the graph consists of two main elements:

1. A horizontal black line representing the x-axis, running across the length of the image.
2. A blue curve, representing the sigmoid function itself. The curve starts at the bottom left, is almost horizontal and very close to the x-axis. It then rises sharply around the center of the graph, passing through a vertical black line before flattening again to become almost horizontal and parallel to the x-axis toward the top right side.

There is a vertical black line intersecting the x-axis at the point where the blue curve's slope is steepest. Below the intersection point on the x-axis is a small circle, which appears to denote the origin or a specific point of interest on the graph.
