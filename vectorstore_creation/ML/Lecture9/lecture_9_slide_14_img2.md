# Here is what the image 2 in slide 14 of lecture 9 contains:

The image depicts a neural network diagram with three layers: input layer, hidden layer, and Softmax output layer.

- **Input Layer**: 
  - Contains three nodes arranged horizontally at the bottom. 
  - Two nodes labeled as \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are represented as green circles.
  - The third node, a beige circle, has a constant label "1".

- **Hidden Layer**:
  - Contains three nodes arranged horizontally in the middle.
  - Each node is represented as a blue circle with a summation symbol (\(\sum\)) divided by a horizontal line, indicating some activation (e.g., ReLU).
  - These nodes are labeled with dashed annotations on the right as "Hidden layer (e.g., ReLU)".

- **Softmax Output Layer**:
  - Contains three nodes arranged horizontally at the top.
  - Each node is represented as a blue circle with a summation symbol (\(\sum\)), and an upward arrow extends from each to a rectangular box labeled "Softmax" above them.
  - Nodes are labeled with dashed annotations as "Softmax output layer".

- **Connections**:
  - Arrows connect every lower node to every higher node from one layer to the next, forming a densely connected network.
  - Arrows point upward, indicating the flow of data from inputs to outputs.

- **Annotations**:
  - The layers are labeled via right-side annotations: "Input layer", "Hidden layer (e.g., ReLU)", and "Softmax output layer", all inside dashed brackets.

Overall, the diagram represents a feedforward neural network structure with labeled input, hidden, and output layers.
