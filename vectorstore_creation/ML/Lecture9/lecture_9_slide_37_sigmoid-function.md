# Slide 37 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Sigmoid Function.

The Logistic function, noted as σ(·), is a sigmoid function that is S-shaped and outputs values between 0 and 1, which we remember from Estimating Probabilities by Logistic Regression. The Sigmoid function is a type of activation function, also known as a squashing function. Squashing functions limit output to a range between 0 and 1. An activation function determines the output behaviour of each node, or "neuron" in an ANN, and is used in testing of ANNs.
