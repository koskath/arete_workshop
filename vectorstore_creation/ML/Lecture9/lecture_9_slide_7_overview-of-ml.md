# Slide 7 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Overview of ML.

The Objective function is a real valued function that provides a measure of how wrong the model is in terms of its ability to estimate the relationship between inputs and outputs. Examples include the mean square error function, cross-entropy function for classification problems, and Maximum Likelihood estimation. The Optimization Algorithm minimizes or maximizes function f(x) by altering x. Gradient descent reduces f(x) by moving x in the opposite sign of the derivative.
