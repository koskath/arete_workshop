# Here is what the mathematical expressions in slide 25 of lecture 9 contain:

The two mathematical expressions are side by side.

On the left, the first expression is:
1. The word "heaviside" in lowercase, followed by a space and the letter "z" in parentheses, resulting in "heaviside (z)".
2. Next to it is an equals sign "=".
3. Following the equals sign is an open curly brace, "{".
4. Two cases are listed vertically to the right of the curly brace:
   - "0" followed by "if z < 0" on the first line.
   - "1" followed by "if z ≥ 0" on the second line.

On the right, the second expression is:
1. The letters "sgn" in lowercase, followed by a space and the letter "z" in parentheses, resulting in "sgn (z)".
2. Next to it is an equals sign "=".
3. Following the equals sign is an open curly brace, "{".
4. Three cases are listed vertically to the right of the curly brace:
   - "-1" followed by "if z < 0" on the first line.
   - "0" followed by "if z = 0" on the second line.
   - "+1" followed by "if z > 0" on the third line.
