# Slide 4 of Lecture 9 contains information about the ML and Deep Learning History.

The 1950s and 1960s saw initial excitement in the field. The Perceptron emerged as a linear classifier using stochastic gradient descent roughly. However, there was a drop in popularity when researchers realized the limitations of linear models. In the 1970s and 1980s, Connectionism emerged as a brain-inspired approach to machine learning, focusing on creating connected networks of simple units. Adding hidden layers z increased expressive power, and there was success in optical character recognition. The 1990s and early-2000s saw another drop in popularity, with a rise in popularity of logistic regression and SVMs with regularization and kernels.
