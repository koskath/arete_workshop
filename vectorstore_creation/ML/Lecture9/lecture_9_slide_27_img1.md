# Here is what the image 1 in slide 27 of lecture 9 contains:

The image depicts a diagram of a neural network with three layers: an "Input layer," a "Hidden layer," and an "Output layer," labeled on the right with dashed curves. 

1. **Input Layer**:
   - Contains three input nodes.
   - The first input node on the left is a beige circle with the number "1" inside.
   - The second and third input nodes are green circles, labeled with "x₁" and "x₂" respectively.
   - Each input node has an upward arrow connected to it, indicating input into the network.

2. **Hidden Layer**:
   - Contains four nodes arranged horizontally.
   - Each node is a blue circle bisected by a horizontal line.
   - The upper half of each circle contains a step function symbol, and the lower half contains a sigma (Σ) symbol.
   - Each node in the hidden layer receives multiple arrows coming from each input node, indicating connections.

3. **Output Layer**:
   - Comprises three nodes similar in structure to those in the hidden layer, with a blue circle, a step function symbol in the upper half, and a sigma (Σ) symbol in the lower half.
   - Each node is connected by arrows from all nodes in the hidden layer.
   - Each node in the output layer has a single upward arrow extending from the top.

The nodes and connections form a fully connected feedforward network with all nodes in one layer linked to every node in the subsequent layer by directional arrows.
