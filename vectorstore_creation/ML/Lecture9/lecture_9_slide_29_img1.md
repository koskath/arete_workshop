# Here is what the image 1 in slide 29 of lecture 9 contains:

The image depicts a diagram featuring a circle in the center. Inside the circle is the expression "f(x, y)". 

Two arrows point towards the circle from the left side:
1. The upper arrow is labeled "x" and points towards the left side of the circle.
2. The lower arrow is labeled "y" and also points towards the left side of the circle.

An arrow extends from the right side of the circle, pointing to the right, and is labeled "z". 

The circle and arrows suggest a function or process where inputs "x" and "y" are transformed to produce an output "z". The arrows are straight and have arrowheads indicating direction towards or away from the circle.

# Here is what the image 2 in slide 29 of lecture 9 contains:

The image depicts a simple neural network diagram consisting of three layers: an Input Layer, a Hidden Layer, and an Output Layer.

- **Input Layer**: 
  - Located at the top of the diagram.
  - Contains four circles colored in blue.
  - Each circle is connected to the circles in the layer below by black lines.
  - Four black arrows point downwards, one from each blue circle.

- **Hidden Layer**:
  - Located in the middle of the diagram.
  - Contains four circles colored in green.
  - Each green circle has lines connecting it to every blue circle in the layer above and to every orange circle in the layer below.

- **Output Layer**:
  - Located at the bottom of the diagram.
  - Comprised of four circles colored in orange.
  - Each orange circle is connected to each green circle in the layer above by black lines.
  - Four black arrows point downwards from the orange circles.

Labels are present on the left side of the diagram:
- "Input Layer" is adjacent to the top layer of blue circles.
- "Hidden Layer" is adjacent to the middle layer of green circles.
- "Output Layer" is adjacent to the bottom layer of orange circles.

In summary, the neural network is fully connected, meaning every node in one layer is connected to every node in the next layer. The lines and arrows illustrate the direction of connections from the input to output layers.
