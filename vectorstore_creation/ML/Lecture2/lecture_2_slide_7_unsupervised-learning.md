# Slide 7 of Lecture 2 contains information about the Unsupervised Learning.

Labels are not provided in unsupervised learning, so the algorithm infers structure directly from the data, for example finding an outlier in transactions. Algorithms include clustering approaches such as K-means, Hierarchical CA, and DBSCAN, along with dimensionality reduction techniques like principal components analysis (PCA).
