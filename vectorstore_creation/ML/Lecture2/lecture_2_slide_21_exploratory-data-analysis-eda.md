# Slide 21 of Lecture 2 contains information about the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach that relies on a range of techniques, mostly graphical, to uncover underlying structure, extract important variables, detect outliers and anomalies, test underlying assumptions, develop parsimonious models, and determine optimal factor settings.
