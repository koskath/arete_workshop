# Here is what the image 2 in slide 22 of lecture 2 contains:

The image is a scatter plot representing data with two axes. The x-axis is labeled "culmen_length_mm" with values ranging from 30 to 60, marked at intervals of 5 mm. The y-axis is labeled "culmen_depth_mm" with values ranging from 14 to 22, marked at intervals of 2 mm.

There are three distinct groups of data points, differentiated by color:

1. Blue data points, representing the "Adelie" category, are primarily clustered in the region where the x-axis values range from 35 to 42, and the y-axis values range from 17 to 21.

2. Orange data points, representing the "Chinstrap" category, appear mostly in the region where the x-axis ranges from 39 to 55, and the y-axis ranges from 16 to 21.

3. Green data points, representing the "Gentoo" category, are mainly located where the x-axis values range from 40 to 50, and the y-axis values range from 14 to 16.

In the top-right corner is a legend labeled "species_short," with three colored circles and corresponding labels:
- A blue circle labeled "Adelie."
- An orange circle labeled "Chinstrap."
- A green circle labeled "Gentoo."

Numbers and grid lines demarcate the axis values. The plot forms a distinct visual separation between the three species, illustrated by non-overlapping blue, orange, and green areas.
