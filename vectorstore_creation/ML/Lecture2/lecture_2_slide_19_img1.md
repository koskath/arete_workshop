# Here is what the image 1 in slide 19 of lecture 2 contains:

The image contains a transformation example involving a table and encoding. 

On the left side, there is a table labeled "body_mass_g" at the top. The label has an underline, emphasizing it as the column header. Below the label are five numerical entries listed vertically: 
- 3750.0
- 3800.0
- 3250.0
- 3450.0
- 3650.0
There is an ellipsis ("...") at the bottom, indicating continuation.

On the right side, another table is labeled "size" at the top. Similar to the left, the label is underlined. Listed beneath are five numerical entries:
- 30
- 32
- 11
- 18
- 26
An ellipsis ("...") appears at the bottom as well, indicating continuation.

Between the two tables, there is a curved arrow pointing from the "body_mass_g" column to the "size" column, suggesting transformation or encoding of data.

Below both tables, there's the text "sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder()" in red. The font size is larger than the text in the tables, and it is centered horizontally across the bottom.
