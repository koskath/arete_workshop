# Slide 3 of Lecture 2 contains information about the sCategories of ML:.


Supervised ML models are trained with labeled data sets, while unsupervised ML models look for patterns in unlabeled data, and reinforcement ML relies on trial and error supported by a reward system to guide machines toward the best actions. These approaches also carry challenges because it can be difficult to precisely specify the task, and the learning process itself may be dangerous depending on the domain.
