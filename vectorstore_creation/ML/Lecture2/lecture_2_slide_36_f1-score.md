# Slide 36 of Lecture 2 contains information about the F1 Score.

The F1 score, also called the balanced F-score or F-measure, is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, reaching its best value at 1 and worst at 0, with precision and recall contributing equally to the metric; by default, F1 is calculated as 0 when there are no true positives, false negatives, or false positives, and it is preferable to accuracy for class-imbalanced datasets.

* F1 = 2 * ((Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)) *
