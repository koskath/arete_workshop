# Here is what the image 1 in slide 24 of lecture 5 contains:

The image contains a mathematical equation centered and using a serif font, written as follows:

On the left side of the equation is the uppercase letter "A." It is followed by an equals sign "=".

To the right of the equals sign is a large summation symbol "∑". The index of summation is denoted by "i=1" positioned below the summation symbol, and the upper limit of the summation is denoted by "r" positioned above the summation symbol.

To the right of the summation symbol are terms inside the summation: 

- The lowercase Greek letter "σ" with the subscript "i" forming "σ₁".
- A bold lowercase letter "u" with the subscript "i" forming "𝑢ᵢ".
- A bold lowercase letter "v" with the subscript "i" forming "𝑣ᵢ", followed by a superscript "T" written as "𝑣ᵢˢᵀ".

The components are positioned in a typical mathematical notation for the singular value decomposition of a matrix.
