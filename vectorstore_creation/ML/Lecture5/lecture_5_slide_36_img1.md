# Here is what the image 1 in slide 36 of lecture 5 contains:

The image depicts a hierarchical tree structure with nodes and arrows. The nodes are of two distinct shapes and colors: squares and circles.

- At the top of the tree is a single dark blue square node.
- From this top node, three black arrows point downward and outward, each leading to another dark blue square node, resulting in three square nodes at the second level.
- From the leftmost square node on the second level, two black arrows extend downward and outward, leading to two green circle nodes.
- The middle square node on the second level similarly has two arrows pointing downward and outward to two green circle nodes.
- The rightmost square node on the second level has two black arrows pointing downward and outward, leading to one green circle node and one more dark blue square node.
- From the additional dark blue square node on the rightmost chain, two black arrows extend downward and outward, each terminating at a green circle node.
- In total, there are four square nodes (three on the second level, one on the third level in the rightmost position) and seven green circle nodes.
- All arrows are black, with arrowheads pointing from squares to circles or other squares, indicating directionality from parental nodes to child nodes.

The layout clearly shows the connections and hierarchical structure of a balanced tree with multiple branches.
