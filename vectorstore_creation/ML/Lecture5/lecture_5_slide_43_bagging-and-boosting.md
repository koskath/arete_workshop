# Slide 43 of Lecture 5 contains information about the Bagging and Boosting.

Bagging and boosting both train classifiers—often with different algorithms or on different views of the data—that tend to make different types of errors, and by combining their outputs in an ensemble, we can improve overall predictive accuracy.
