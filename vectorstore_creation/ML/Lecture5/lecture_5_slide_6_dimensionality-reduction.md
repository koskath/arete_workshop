# Slide 6 of Lecture 5 contains information about the Dimensionality Reduction.

Dimensionality reduction approaches can be unsupervised, where class labels are not required and techniques such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used for tasks like visualization and noise removal, or supervised, where class labels are considered and methods such as Mixture Discriminant Analysis (MDA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) are especially useful in domains like biometrics, bioinformatics, and chemistry.
