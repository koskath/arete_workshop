# Here is what the image 2 in slide 24 of lecture 5 contains:

The image contains a mathematical equation centered horizontally. The equation is:

- The capital letter "A" on the left, followed by an equals sign "=".
- To the right of the equals sign is a summation symbol "∑", which is enlarged and positioned vertically.
- Directly above the summation symbol is the letter "r", indicating the upper limit of the summation.
- Directly below the summation symbol is the expression "i = 1", showing the index and its starting value.
- To the right of the summation symbol is "σ_i", with "σ" as a lowercase Greek letter and "i" as its subscript.
- Following "σ_i" is the bold lowercase letter "u" with subscript "i".
- Next is a bold lowercase letter "v" with a subscript "i" followed by a superscript "T".
  
All elements are written in a serif font style commonly used in mathematical typesetting. The components are aligned to be visually centered around the summation symbol. The subscripts and superscripts are smaller than the main symbols.
