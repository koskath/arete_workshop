# Slide 19 of Lecture 5 contains information about the Incremental & Kernel PCA.

Incremental PCA (IPCA) approximates the same projection as standard PCA by processing only a few samples at a time and storing estimates of component and noise variances so that the explained-variance ratio can be updated incrementally, while Kernel PCA finds a projection that can make the data linearly separable and supports both forward transforms and inverse transforms.
