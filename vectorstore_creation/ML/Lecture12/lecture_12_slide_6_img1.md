# Here is what the image 1 in slide 6 of lecture 12 contains:

The image depicts a diagram of a neural network structure. It consists of two distinct layers: "Encoder" and "Decoder."

1. **Nodes and Layers:**
   - The bottom layer, labeled "Encoder," consists of three nodes arranged horizontally. These nodes are filled in light blue.
   - The nodes are labeled from left to right as \(x_1\), \(x_2\), and \(x_3\).
   - The top layer, labeled "Decoder," also consists of three nodes arranged horizontally with the same light blue fill.
   - These nodes are labeled from left to right as \(x'_1\), \(x'_2\), and \(x'_3\).

2. **Arrows and Connections:**
   - Each node in the "Encoder" layer is connected to every node in the "Decoder" layer through directed arrows.
   - The arrows originate from each "Encoder" node and point towards each "Decoder" node, forming a fully connected bipartite network between the two layers.
   - The arrowheads are filled with a darker shade to differentiate from the lines.

3. **Annotations:**
   - The terms "Encoder" and "Decoder" are marked with braces on the right side, indicating the grouping of each set of nodes as either encoding or decoding components of the network.

The diagram is a simple representation of an autoencoder architecture, consisting of an encoding phase and a decoding phase depicted by connected nodes.
