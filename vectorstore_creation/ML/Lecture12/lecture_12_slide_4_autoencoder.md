# Slide 4 of Lecture 12 contains information about the Autoencoder.

Autoencoders are unsupervised (self-supervised) neural networks that act as generative models capable of randomly creating new data that closely resembles the training distribution. They learn dense latent representations or codings of the input, typically at a much lower dimensionality, which makes them valuable for dimensionality reduction and visualization. At their core, autoencoders simply learn to copy their inputs to their outputs while compressing and reconstructing the information through the latent space.
