# Here is what the image 1 in slide 6 of lecture 4 contains:

The image contains a diagram illustrating a concept in supervised learning. At the top center, there is a rectangular box filled with a dark gray color labeled "Supervised Learning" in white text. From this box, two black lines with arrows extend downward, branching into two separate paths.

The line on the left points to an oval shape filled with a light green color, labeled "Regression" in black text. Below this oval, in parentheses, is the label "(Real-valued output)" in black text.

The line on the right points to another oval shape filled with a light blue color, labeled "Classification" in black text. Below this oval, in parentheses, is the label "(Discrete values, Boolean Categories)" in black text.

The diagram is structured such that "Supervised Learning" is the parent category, branching into the two subcategories, "Regression" and "Classification", which are differentiated by their distinct color fills and respective annotations.
