# Slide 35 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Logistic Regression and ML.

Logistic regression is a discriminative model that distinguishes between classes or categories but cannot generate new examples of the class it predicts (such as images of cats); in machine learning it typically uses the negative log-likelihood as a loss function and applies gradient descent to find optimal parameters, yet it can be prone to overfitting when many predictors are included, so regularization is often applied to penalize large coefficients in high-dimensional settings.
