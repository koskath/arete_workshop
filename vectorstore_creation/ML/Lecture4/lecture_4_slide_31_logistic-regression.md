# Slide 31 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Logistic Regression.

Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring—such as whether someone voted or did not vote—based on a set of independent variables, producing an outcome bounded between 0 and 1; also known as the logit model, it is widely used for classification and predictive analytics and applies a logit transformation to P(Success)/P(Failure) (the log odds), typically requiring a relatively large sample size for stable estimates.
