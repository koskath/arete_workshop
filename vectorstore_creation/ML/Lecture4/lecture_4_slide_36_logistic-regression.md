# Slide 36 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Logistic Regression.

Logistic regression estimates the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables in order to predict a categorical outcome—such as true/false, yes/no, or 1/0—by applying the logit function to transform the S-shaped probability curve into a straight line, and it is commonly used in fraud detection (to identify anomalous, fraud-predictive data), disease prediction (to estimate disease likelihood), and churn prediction (to flag behaviors indicative of customer or user churn).
