# Slide 4 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Fundamentals of Machine Learning.

Supervised learning focuses on predicting values when the targets are known: the user supplies correct answers for the model to learn from, and the machine then uses this information to guess new answers, typically through two categories—regression, which estimates continuous values, and classification, which identifies a unique class.
