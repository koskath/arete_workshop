# Slide 5 of Lecture 4 contains information about the How supervised ML works?.

Supervised ML typically proceeds by collecting and preprocessing data, splitting it into training and test sets, choosing an algorithm and setting its hyperparameters, training a model on the training data, and then evaluating its performance on the test data, repeating the split–train–evaluate cycle until the results are satisfactory (see also https://www.javatpoint.com/supervised-machine-learning for a visual illustration).
