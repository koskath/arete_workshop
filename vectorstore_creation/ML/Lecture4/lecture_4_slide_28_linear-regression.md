# Slide 28 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Linear Regression.

• Linear regression models identify relationship between a continuous dependent
variable and one or more independent variables.
• Linear regression produces a probability.
• Simple linear regression supports one independent variable and one dependent
variable
• Multiple linear regression supports more independent variables.
• For each type of linear regression, it seeks to plot a line of best fit through a set of
data points.
