# Here is what the image 1 in slide 24 of lecture 4 contains:

The image shows a scatter plot with a regression line. The graph is set on a Cartesian coordinate system with two axes:

1. **Axes**:
   - The horizontal axis is labeled "independent Variables" in red, with the letter "X" next to it in black.
   - The vertical axis is labeled "dependent Variable" in red, with the letter "Y" next to it in black.
   - Both axes are marked with arrowheads, indicating direction.

2. **Data Points**:
   - There are multiple blue circular data points scattered across the graph.
   - The points are distributed around a central line, indicating a linear relationship.

3. **Line of Regression**:
   - A black straight line runs diagonally from the lower left to the upper right, representing the line of regression.
   - It passes through the cluster of data points, illustrating the best fit line.

4. **Annotations**:
   - There are two annotations in red with black arrows pointing to specific elements:
     - "Datapoints" with two arrows pointing towards the clusters of blue data points.
     - "Line of regression" with an arrow pointing directly at the black regression line.

The plot visually represents the relationship between dependent and independent variables, with clear labels and structure to identify key elements.
