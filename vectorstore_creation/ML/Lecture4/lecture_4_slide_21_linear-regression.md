# Slide 21 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Linear Regression.

Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of one variable based on the value of another, treating the variable to be predicted as the dependent variable and the predictor as the independent variable, and it estimates coefficients in a linear equation involving one or more independent variables that best predict the dependent variable’s value.
