# Slide 17 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Applications of k-NN.

KNN has many applications, including data preprocessing where it can impute missing values, recommendation engines that use clickstream data to suggest additional content, finance where credit data helps banks assess loan risk, healthcare tasks such as predicting heart-attack and prostate-cancer risk, and pattern recognition problems like text and digit classification (see https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/knn).
