# Here is what the image 1 in slide 23 of lecture 4 contains:

The image consists of two panels side by side.

**Left Panel:**

- The vertical axis is labeled "y" and the horizontal axis is labeled "x₁".
- Both axes are depicted with thick black lines ending in arrowheads pointing outward.
- The origin of the axes is at the bottom-left corner.
- There are six beige circular data points distributed vertically above a blue horizontal line.
- The data points are equally spaced along the x₁-axis.
- Each data point has a red vertical arrow pointing downward, connecting the center of the circle to the blue line. 
- The arrows vary in length corresponding to the vertical position of the circles above the blue line.
- The blue line is straight and horizontal, situated at the bottom of the data points, parallel to the x₁-axis.

**Right Panel:**

- The vertical axis is labeled "y" and the horizontal axis is labeled "x₁".
- Both axes are depicted with thick black lines ending in arrowheads pointing outward.
- The origin of the axes is at the bottom-left corner.
- There are six beige circular data points distributed around a blue diagonal line that slopes upward from left to right.
- Each data point has a red vertical arrow indicating the direction of the discrepancy from the blue line, with five arrows pointing downward and one pointing upward.
- The blue diagonal line intersects the x₁-axis below the leftmost data point and lies approximately at the mid-height of the rightmost set of data points.

Both panels illustrate different graphical arrangements of data points and reference lines, with clear visible arrows indicating how the points relate to the lines.
