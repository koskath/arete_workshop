# Slide 25 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Linear Regression.

• LR: y' = b + w x ; y' = b + w x + w x + w x (Three features)
1 1 1 1 2 2 3 3
• y' is predicted label (a desired output)
• b is bias (y-intercept)
• w is weight of feature 1 (slope);
1
• x is feature (input)
1 sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()
• ML algorithm for linear regression attempts to find values for b and w that
i
minimizes the loss (e.g. mean squared error).
