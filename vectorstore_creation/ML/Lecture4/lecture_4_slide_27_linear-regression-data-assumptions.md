# Slide 27 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Linear Regression: Data Assumptions.

• Variables should be measured at a continuous level (time, sales, weight).
• Use a scatterplot to find out quickly if there is a linear relationship between those
two variables.
• The observations should be independent of each other.
• Your data should have no significant outliers.
• Check that the variances along the best-fit linear-regression line remain similar all
through that line.
• The residuals (errors) of the best-fit regression line follow normal distribution.
