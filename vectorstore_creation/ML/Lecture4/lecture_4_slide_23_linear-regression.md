# Slide 23 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Linear Regression.

Linear regression is a common parametric approach to regression problems in which the model fits a straight line or surface that minimizes discrepancies between predicted and actual output values, often using the least-squares method to find the best-fit line for paired data, as described in resources such as https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/descending-into-ml/training-and-loss.
