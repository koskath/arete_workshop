# Here is what the image 2 in slide 51 of lecture 1 contains:

The image contains two textual elements on a dark grey-blue background.

1. The first text block at the top reads:
   "* It’s very hard to say how much data will be needed until you start to analyze your problem in detail, but often you need hundreds, thousands, or millions of examples."

2. The second text block beneath the first reads:
   "** For example: Have humans not focused on this problem before? Was the data about this problem not available before? Can the patterns here, if they exist, only be detected by looking at more data than humans can really process?"

Each text block begins with an asterisk or a double asterisk, respectively. The text is white and centered, with a clear and evenly spaced font, aligning horizontally across the center of the image.
