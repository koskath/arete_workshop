# Slide 41 of Lecture 1 contains information about the Example.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 41 of lecture 1 contains:

The image is a screenshot from a documentation page related to the `sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB` class from the Scikit-learn library.

1. **Header:**
   - The top section has a light blue background.
   - In this section, the text `sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB` is written in bold, with the "sklearn" path in a grey-blue font and "GaussianNB" in a black font.

2. **Source Link:**
   - On the right side of the header, within square brackets, there is a blue hyperlink `[source]`.

3. **Class Definition:**
   - Below the header, the class definition is shown in a monospace font with a tan background.
   - It reads: 
     `class sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB(*, priors=None, var_smoothing=1e-09)`

4. **Description:**
   - A plain text section follows with the text "Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)."
   - Describes the function of the class, stating it "can perform online updates to model parameters via partial_fit."

5. **Reference Link:**
   - Provides a reference to a technical report by Chan, Golub, and LeVeque.
   - The link to the report is presented as an active hyperlink: 
     `http://i.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/79/773/CS-TR-79-773.pdf`

6. **User Guide:**
   - A sentence "Read more in the User Guide." is present, where "User Guide" is a blue hyperlink.

7. **Parameters Section:**
   - Encased in a thin grey border, this section is titled "Parameters:" and introduces bullet points.
   - Two parameters are described:
     - `priors : array-like of shape (n_classes,), default=None`
       - Below, it explains: "Prior probabilities of the classes. If specified, the priors are not adjusted according to the data."
     - `var_smoothing : float, default=1e-9`
       - Below, it explains: "Portion of the largest variance of all features that is added to variances for calculation stability."

8. **Version Note:**
   - A bolded text in grey states: "New in version 0.20."

The page is organized with clear headers, subheaders, hyperlinks, and descriptions, typical of API documentation.
