# The purpose of the image 2 in slide 35 of lecture 1:
is to contrast a humorous simplification of machine learning—represented by the comic’s metaphor of “stirring the pile until the answers look right”—with real-world examples of Tesla Autopilot crashes, emphasizing how oversimplifying or overtrusting complex ML systems can lead to serious consequences. It highlights the gap between the intuitive, almost magical expectations people often project onto machine learning and the reality that these systems depend heavily on data quality, model design, and rigorous validation. Together, the images serve as a reminder that while ML can appear straightforward or even mysterious from the outside, its limitations and failure modes must be understood and respected, especially when deployed in safety-critical applications.
