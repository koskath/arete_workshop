# Here is what the image 1 in slide 50 of lecture 1 contains:

The image presents a two-dimensional scatter plot with the x-axis labeled "Feature 1" and the y-axis labeled "Feature 2." Both axes have gray arrows indicating positive directions, with the y-axis arrow pointing upwards and the x-axis arrow pointing to the right.

In the plot, there are two types of data points: green triangles and yellow squares. The green triangles are generally located towards the upper left region of the plot, while the yellow squares are situated towards the right and lower areas. 

A dashed line, labeled "Model," curves across the plot, forming a rough boundary between the regions predominantly occupied by green triangles (above and to the left) and yellow squares (below and to the right). This line suggests a decision boundary for classification.

Near the center of the plot and slightly towards the right side, a black "X" labeled "New instance" is placed, positioned closer to the green triangle region but within an ambiguity zone relative to the dashed boundary suggesting decision regions.

The annotations "Model" and "New instance" are in black font, and they respectively align above the dashed line and next to the "X" point. The overall background is white, and the elements inside are clearly defined with distinct boundaries and filled colors for each type of data point.
