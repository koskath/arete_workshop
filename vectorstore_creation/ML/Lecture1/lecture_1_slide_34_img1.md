# Here is what the image 1 in slide 34 of lecture 1 contains:

The image is a graph titled "Hype Cycle for Artificial Intelligence, 2024," depicting the lifecycle of AI technologies in a hype cycle format. The graph has two axes: the vertical axis represents "Expectations," and the horizontal axis represents "Time," with the cycle divided into five stages: "Innovation Trigger," "Peak of Inflated Expectations," "Trough of Disillusionment," "Slope of Enlightenment," and "Plateau of Productivity."

Each technology is placed along a curve representing the progression through these stages. The technologies are marked with symbols indicating the time to reach the plateau:

1. **Less than 2 years (empty circle)**
2. **2 to 5 years (light blue circle)**
3. **5 to 10 years (dark blue circle)**
4. **More than 10 years (orange triangle)**
5. **Obsolete before plateau (red X mark)**

From the starting point in "Innovation Trigger" to the midpoint on the curve, the technologies and their indicators are as follows:

- Autonomic Systems (orange triangle)
- Quantum AI (orange triangle)
- First-Principles AI (dark blue circle)
- Embodied AI (dark blue circle)
- Multiagent Systems (dark blue circle)
- AI Simulation (dark blue circle)
- Causal AI (dark blue circle)
- AI-Ready Data (dark blue circle)
- Decision Intelligence (dark blue circle)
- Neuro-Symbolic AI (dark blue circle)
- Artificial General Intelligence (dark blue circle)
- Composite AI (dark blue circle)
- Sovereign AI (dark blue circle)
- AI TRISM (dark blue circle)
- Prompt Engineering (dark blue circle)
- Responsible AI (dark blue circle)

At the "Peak of Inflated Expectations" and moving towards the "Trough of Disillusionment":

- AI Engineering (orange triangle)
- Edge AI (light blue circle)
- Foundation Models (light blue circle)
- Synthetic Data (light blue circle)
- ModelOps (light blue circle)
- Generative AI (light blue circle)

Continuing through the "Trough of Disillusionment":

- Neuromorphic Computing (dark blue circle)
- Smart Robots (dark blue circle)

Into the "Slope of Enlightenment":

- Knowledge Graphs (light blue circle)
- Autonomous Vehicles (light blue circle)
- Intelligent Applications (light blue circle)

Finally, reaching the "Plateau of Productivity":

- Computer Vision (empty circle)
