Research integrity table with three main columns titled "Component," "Examples," and "Example governance mechanisms." The table has three row sections:

1. **Not engaging in misrepresentation and fraud (2.1)**
   - Examples:
     - Bullet points: Fabricating data, Falsifying results, Serious misrepresentation of findings, Conflicts of interest.
   - Example governance mechanisms:
     - Bullet points: Codes of conduct, Peer review, Processes to support/protect whistle blowers, Formal censure and/or future restrictions/bans by publication venues, conferences, professional bodies, institutional home or funding agency, Legal action, Mandatory disclosure of conflicts of interest, Publication venue policies (e.g., not publishing work by actors who stand to benefit from the findings), Pre-registration, Making funding available for research that is independent of interested or possibly conflicting parties.

2. **Reproducibility and replicability (2.2)**
   - Examples:
     - Bullet points: Reproducibility (e.g., sharing data, code), Replicability including statistically sound performance claims, Reliability and validity issues, Producing trustworthy results, Proof/evidence of claims, Disclosure of complexity/compute requirements.
   - Example governance mechanisms:
     - Bullet points: Pre-registration, Reproducibility badges, Reproducibility checklists, Data publication requirements or code release, Required disclosure of experimental details (e.g., compute spending), Peer review to scrutinise statistical claims, Funding scientific reproduction projects including for research that would be prohibitively expensive for non-industry researchers.

3. **Addressing assumptions and limitations (2.3)**
   - Examples:
     - Bullet points: Disclosure of assumptions and conditions under which claims hold (including generalisability), Quantifying uncertainty, Discussion of project limitations, Discussion of dataset limitations including bias.
   - Example governance mechanisms:
     - Bullet points: Standardized reporting practices (e.g., datasheets and model cards), Publication norms and requirements (e.g., mandating a discussion of limitations, error bars on charts), Peer review to scrutinise evidence of claims and to verify other publication norms and requirements, Research community norms.

Each cell with content includes systematically listed bullet points. The table is organized within a grid with alternating shaded and non-shaded row backgrounds.
