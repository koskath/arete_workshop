# Slide 17 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Metaphysical Issues.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 17 of lecture 15 contains:

The image is a table with six rows and two columns. The rows are numbered from the top 1 to 6, although the numbers are not shown explicitly. The columns are separated by vertical lines, and the rows are separated by horizontal lines. The first column contains no visible content and is positioned to the left, serving as a margin. The second column contains text in each row, centered vertically within each cell:

1. The first row reads, "Machine consciousness."
2. The second row reads, "“Awakening” of AI," with the word "Awakening" in double quotation marks.
3. The third row reads, "Autonomous moral agents."
4. The fourth row reads, "Super-intelligence."
5. The fifth row reads, "Singularity."
6. The sixth row reads, "Changes to human nature."

Each cell in the second column consists solely of these text elements with consistent font and alignment. The table has a border with visible lines outlining the edges.
