# Here is what the image 1 in slide 38 of lecture 15 contains:

The image consists of a flowchart with four main rectangular components connected by arrows. 

1. **Program Box:**
   - Positioned on the far left.
   - Divided into two horizontal sections.
   - **Upper Section:** 
     - Contains the text: 
       - "int x, y, z;"
       - "-2x + 3y + z < 110"
       - "x + 2y - 3z > 25"
     - The text is plain, black, and formatted in a monospaced font, resembling programming code.
   - **Lower Section:**
     - Contains the text "minimize (x+y+z)" in blue, monospaced font.
     - Highlighted in a gray background.
     - Below the gray section, it reads "Program" in bold black font.

2. **Program Constraints Box:**
   - Positioned to the upper-right of the Program Box.
   - Light green background.
   - Contains the text:
     - "-2x+3y+z < 110"
     - "x+2y-3z > 25"
   - Text is black with a plain font.
   - "Program Constraints" is written in bold and centered at the top.

3. **Property Constraints Box:**
   - Positioned directly below the Program Constraints Box.
   - Light blue background.
   - Contains the text:
     - "minimize (x+y+z)"
   - Text is black with a plain font.
   - "Property Constraints" is written in bold and centered at the top.

4. **Flow to Right Boxes:**
   - Program Constraints has a black arrow pointing right to a box titled "Linear Constraints" with a matching green background.
   - Property Constraints has a black arrow pointing right to a box titled "Objective Function" with a matching blue background.

Each box is outlined with a simple black border. The arrows are solid black lines pointing horizontally from left to right, indicating progression or transformation of information from the initial Program Box to the Linear and Objective boxes.
