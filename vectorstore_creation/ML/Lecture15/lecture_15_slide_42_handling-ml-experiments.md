# Slide 42 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Handling ML experiments.

Handling machine learning experiments requires meticulous tracking of provenance: documenting who created the model and when, which hyperparameters and feature transformations were applied, and which datasets were used both for training and for evaluation. This recordkeeping ensures that results remain reproducible and that any discrepancies can be traced back to their source.*** End Patch}$
