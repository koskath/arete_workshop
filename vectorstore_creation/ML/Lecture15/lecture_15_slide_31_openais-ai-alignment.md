# Slide 31 of Lecture 15 contains information about the OpenAI's AI alignment.

OpenAI’s superalignment project concentrates on aligning artificial superintelligence systems by engineering a scalable training signal that stays faithful to human intent. The effort relies on pillars such as training AI systems with human feedback—including reinforcement learning from human feedback as demonstrated in InstructGPT—building AI systems that help humans evaluate complex outputs, and developing AI models that can assist directly with alignment research itself.
