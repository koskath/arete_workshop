# Slide 39 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Verification Techniques.

# Here is what the image 1 in slide 39 of lecture 15 contains:

The image contains a horizontal timeline with a series of overlapping layered arrows in different shades of blue, labeled from top to bottom: "Theorem Proving," "Incomplete Verification," "SMT," and "Linear Programming." Each layer of the timeline represents different verification methods and strategies over time, marked by annotations indicating advancements or milestones:

1. At the far left:
   - Two dark blue horizontal arrows labeled "Theorem Proving" and "Incomplete Verification."
   - An annotation connected to the timeline by a black arrow pointing down, labeled "(2010-2012): First use of SMT Solvers for MLP verification."

2. In the middle-left section:
   - Blue arrows representing "SMT" and "Linear Programming" layers extend rightwards.
   - An annotation connected to the timeline by a black arrow pointing up, labeled "(2016): Neural Network Verification using a Linear Programmer."
   - Another annotation, pointing up, labeled "(2015): Verification of MLPs in closed-loop control applications."

3. In the center:
   - An annotation from the "SMT" layer with an arrow pointing down, labeled "(2017): Use of SMT solver for verification of medium-sized networks."
   - An annotation pointing up from "Theorem Proving," labeled "(2017): Verification of Perceptron Convergence Theorem using Theorem Prover."
   - Another annotation, pointing up, labeled "(2017): Combined use of SMT and Linear Programming Solvers."

4. In the middle-right section:
   - An annotation pointing up from the "Linear Programming" layer, labeled "(2017): Simplex algorithm based SMT solver proposed for verification of ReLU-based Neural Networks."
   - Another annotation pointing up, labeled "(2017-2018): Verification based on Output Reachable Set Estimation."

5. Moving further to the right:
   - A black arrow pointing down from the "SMT" layer to an annotation labeled "(2018): Bisection of Over-approximated ReLU nodes to verify ReLU-based networks."
   - A black arrow pointing down from the "SMT" layer to an annotation labeled "(2018): BNN Verification using SAT Solvers."

6. Near the far right:
   - An annotation pointing up from the "Linear Programming" layer, labeled "(2018-2019): Zonotope Abstraction of Neural Networks for incomplete, yet scalable, verification."

7. At the far right:
   - A black arrow pointing down from the "SMT" layer to an annotation labeled "(2019): Use of a Linear Programming Solver for the verification of large Neural Networks, including ResNet."

The background is white, creating a clear contrast for the text and arrows.
