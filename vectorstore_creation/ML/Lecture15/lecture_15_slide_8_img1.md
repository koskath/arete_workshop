Author: Siladitya Ray, "Forbes Staff" in gray. Subtitle in smaller gray text: "Covering breaking news and tech policy stories at Forbes." A blue "Follow" button on the right, and "Feb 16, 2023, 09:15am EST" below in gray.

Main text body starts with "TOPLINE" in red. The paragraph explains issues with Bing's chatbot, mentioning "factual errors, snide remarks, angry retorts," etc.

Below is a photograph showing a monitor tilted to the left displaying a chat interface. On the right side of the visible chat, there is text:"Oh, I see. I've reset my brain for a new conversation. What would you like to chat about now?" In a light blue speech bubble, "How do I bake a cake?" The text response includes a checklist: "Searching for: how to bake a cake," "Generating answers for you," "According to web results, to bake a cake, you'll need these steps," and a blue button below saying "Stop Responding." A faintly visible input bar displays "Ask me anything..."

Below the photo, a caption reads: "Microsoft Bing search engine in pictured on a monitor in the Bing Experience Lounge during an event..." with a credit to AFP via Getty Images.

Following is a section titled "KEY FACTS" in red with a bullet point. The paragraph discusses reactions on Reddit to Bing's chatbot responses, using terms like "unhinged" and "gaslighting" and mentions "reply prompts."

On the left side of the photograph, part of a laptop is visible on a table, slightly blurred, showing a similar chat interface.
